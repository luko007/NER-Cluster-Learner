   Shortly after Fossett's launching Monday his competitors sent
him telegrams of congratulation.
<p>
   The British balloon, called the Virgin Global Challenger, is to
be flown by Richard Branson, chairman of Virgin Atlantic Airways;
Per Lindstrand, chairman of Lindstrand Balloons Ltd. of Oswestry,
England, and an Irish balloonist, Rory McCarthy.
<p>
   Branson and Lindstrand, who have set several ballooning records,
were the first pilots of hot-air balloons to cross both the
Atlantic Ocean, in 1987, and the Pacific, in 1991.
<p>
   Lindstrand said that because of unfavorable weather patterns
over England he and his colleagues had decided to launch their
Virgin Global Challenger from a military airfield at Marrakech,
Morocco.
<p>
   To move the big crew capsule, balloon and accessories, the
British group chartered a Beluga transport plane  &MD;  a modified
Airbus 300 similar to the Pregnant Guppy aircraft used by NASA to
transport large rocket components. The flight to Morocco is
scheduled for Friday, and Lindstrand said the balloon launching
would probably take place a day or so later.
<p>
   Branson, chairman of the multifaceted Virgin Group, which
includes Virgin Atlantic Airways, believes that his competitor,
Fossett, faces grave risks.
<p>
   ``Because his capsule is not pressurized,'' Branson said in an
interview, ``Steve will have to stay at around 20,000 feet, which
is usually well below the core of the jet stream. That could slow
him down a lot. We will be at 30,000 to 35,000 feet, where our
chances of riding the high-speed jet stream are much better.
<p>
   ``Steve is incredibly brave, and if anyone should beat us, I'd
rather it was he.''
<p>
   The Dutch team, led by Henk Brink, recently tested the inflation
of its Unicef Flyer balloon at Cape Kennedy in NASA's huge Vehicle
Assembly Building, where space shuttles are prepared for flight.
Brink, who intends to launch his balloon from Nijmegen, the
Netherlands, is a helicopter instructor and veteran balloonist.
<p>
   In 1986, he, his wife, Evelien, and William Hageman, a Dutch
fighter pilot, became the first European balloonists to cross the
Atlantic; so precise was their navigation that they landed within a
few miles of Brink's home in the Netherlands.
<p>
   Although balloons must travel in the same direction as the wind
that carries them along, a pilot can navigate to some extent by
changing altitude to seek wind headed in the desired direction.
Even a small change in altitude can result in a large change in
direction.
<p>
   The Unicef Flyer flight suffered a setback Dec. 26 when its
third crew member, Wouter Bakker, resigned from the flight crew
``for personal reasons.''
<p>
   Days before the expected launching this week, Brink said in an
interview that he had advertised for a replacement, stipulating
that the third crew member should be an airline captain.
<p>
   ``We're down to three candidates,'' Brink said Friday, ``and all
of them are completely familiar with our navigation and
communication equipment. For the launch and landing, I will do the
piloting.''
<p>
   All three teams are flying Rozier balloons  &MD;  a type that has
achieved many long-distance records in recent years.
<p>
   A modern Rozier is kept aloft by helium gas, but to add extra
lift, the balloon is compartmentalized and the lower part can be
filled with hot air from a gas burner. This enables the balloon to
maintain altitude at night, when cold air and the lack of sunlight
cools the helium and lessens its lifting power.
<p>
   Since the first manned balloon flight in 1783 by Jean Francois
Pilatre de Rozier and the Marquis Francois Laurent d'Arlandes in a
Montgolfier hot-air balloon, many balloonists have attempted
round-the-world flights, but all have failed, and some have died
trying.
<p>
   Five unsuccessful attempts were made by a single team led by
Larry Newman of Scottsdale, Ariz., in his Earthwinds balloon before
Newman abandoned his efforts one year ago.
<p>
   The Rozier balloon is named after its inventor, who was forced
to use inflammable hydrogen in his 18th-century version, since a
century was to pass before the discovery of nonflammable helium.
Rozier was killed in 1785 while trying to cross the English
Channel; his hydrogen-and-hot-air hybrid balloon caught fire and
crashed.
<p>
   From that time until 1960, balloonists relied almost exclusively
on hydrogen or helium for lift, since hot-air burners were regarded
as too dangerous.

JULIAN HILL, 91, WHO DISCOVERED NYLON
(lb)
By DAVID STOUT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Julian Hill, a research chemist whose accidental discovery of a
tough, taffylike compound revolutionized everyday life after it
proved its worth in warfare and courtship, died on Sunday in
Hockessin, Del. He was 91.
<p>
   Hill died at the Cokesbury Village retirement community, where
he had lived in recent years with his wife of 62 years, Polly.
<p>
   During the late 1920s, Hill was a member of a Du Pont Co. team
studying the behavior of certain molecules that chain together to
form larger ones, called polymers. The chemists were engaged in
pure research, though finding a substitute for silk was in the back
of their minds.
<p>
   In 1930, while trying to create ever larger structures by
adjusting the amount of water in a batch of carbon- and
alcohol-based molecules, the team came up with a concoction that Du
Pont's research head, Wallace Carothers, thought useless.
<p>
   But Hill was intrigued after sticking a heated glass rod into a
beaker containing the material and finding that it stretched and
pulled, like taffy, and that it became silky when stretched at room
temperature. Soon, Hill and his colleagues were playing with the
material in the corridor and finding that it could be shaped into
strands that were remarkably long and strong.
<p>
   The substance, of course, was nylon, although it would not be so
named until it was introduced at the 1939 World's Fair in New York
 &MD;  hence, the ``ny'' in nylon.
<p>
   ``I tell my wife I was something better than a good scientist,''
Hill recalled in an interview years later. ``I was lucky.'' Since
Du Pont held the patents to nylon, Hill made no great fortune off
the discovery, but his wife said Wednesday that the company had
treated him well over the years.
<p>
   (A sad footnote is the fate of Carothers. Beset by personal
problems that fueled depression, thinking himself a failure despite
a brilliant career, he committed suicide in 1937 at the age of 41.)
<p>
   If the development of nylon was in part serendipity, it was not
a total surprise. Almost a decade earlier, at an American Chemical
Society conference in Buffalo, N.Y., Hill and Carothers reported on
progress in developing ``artificial silks'' like rayon, which was
then coming into use.
<p>
   But rayon is derived from cellulose and in that sense is not
strictly synthetic, as is nylon. Nylon was used initially for
toothbrush bristles, fishing line and surgical sutures. Nylon
stockings were first sold in 1939. They cost twice what silk
stockings did, and women were happy to pay. Nylon stockings were
sheer and strong.
<p>
   The material was deemed so important that its use was restricted
to the military after the United States entered World War II. Nylon
was used to make rope, tents, aircraft tires and parachutes.
<p>
   It also served to improve British-U.S. relations, in a way.
Young American soldiers stationed in Britain made a good impression
on their dates by giving them nylon stockings, available from the
military's post exchanges when they could not be bought elsewhere.
<p>
   The reintroduction of nylon to civilian life after the war
caused a sensation, and at least one stampede. A crowd of 10,000
people jammed a San Francisco department store in 1945, causing the
nylon sale to be called off.
<p>
   In the decades since, nylon has become ubiquitous, as carpeting
and clothing. And about two-thirds of all the luggage manufactured
in the world is made from it.
<p>
   Scientists consider nylon a benign product of technology,
because it has not been found to have any deadly side effects. But
Hill, who loved wildlife and was a dedicated bird-watcher, said in
a 1988 interview that he thought ``the human race is going to
perish by being smothered in plastic.''
<p>
   Julian Werner Hill was born in St. Louis, graduated from
Washington University there in 1924 and earned a doctorate in
organic chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in
1928. His wife recalled on Wednesday that his doctoral studies were
delayed a year because he was stricken with scarlet fever.
<p>
   Hill played the violin and was an accomplished squash player and
figure-skater until his early 40s, when an attack of polio weakened
one leg, his wife said.
<p>
   Before his retirement from Du Pont in 1964, Hill supervised the
company's program of aid to universities for research in physics
and chemistry.
<p>
   Surviving besides his wife are a daughter, Louisa Spottswood of
Philadelphia; two sons, Joseph, of Villanova, Pa., and Jefferson,
of Washington, and five grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<p>
   Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, Feb. 7 (Bloomberg) -- A
chartered Boeing 757 carrying German tourists from the Dominican
Republic crashed into the Caribbean sea last night, leaving no sign
that any of the 189 people on board survived.
<p>
   The U.S. Coast Guard in Miami said it recovered 79 bodies in the
area of the crash, before suspending its search at nightfall today.
It plans to continue the search in the morning.
<p>
   ``We'll continue searching until there is reason to believe
there are no survivors,'' said Petty Officer Scott Carr, a
spokesman for the Coast Guard, this evening. ``We still maintain
hope that somebody is out there and we will try to find them.''
<p>
   Searchers did find some life rafts, but no survivors, the Coast
Guard said. It wasn't clear whether the rafts were dragged out by
survivors or if they inflated on impact.
<p>
   U.S. and Dominican Republic officials said the cause of the
crash was unknown. The owner of the German tour agency that
chartered the plane was quoted by Reuters as saying lightning
struck the Frankfurt-bound 757.
<p>
   Vural Oeger, head of Hamburg-based Oeger Tours, said he was told
by Dominican aviation officials that the plane's engines were
damaged by lightning. Reuters also said the pilots apparently tried
to turn the plane around to return to the airport, but were unable
to and plunged into the Caribbean.
<p>
   A spokeswoman for the German Foreign Ministry said that while
she'd heard rumors of lightning causing the wreck, she couldn't
confirm the reports.
<p>
   The plane crashed just before midnight local time last night,
about five minutes after taking off from the Puerto Plata airport
in the Dominican Republic. Coast Guard officials said rain and
sharks were hampering the rescue efforts.
<p>
   A spokesman for the Seattle-based Boeing Co. said it was sending
a team to help investigate the crash.
<p>
   The aircraft, owned by Turkish company Birgen Air, was leased to
Alas de Transporte Internacional, a Dominican charter airline that
operates mainly during the peak winter season when European
tourists visit the resort town of Puerto Plata, said a spokeswoman
for Aeronautica Civil, the Dominican Republic's aviation agency.
<p>
   Oeger had chartered the plane from Alas.
<p>
   The aircraft, built in 1985, carried 176 passengers, most of
them German tourists, and 13 crew members -- 11 Turkish nationals
and two Dominicans.
<p>
   Russ Young, a Boeing spokesman, said the investigation could
last weeks or months.
<p>
   The jet was the 31st Boeing 757 made and was originally sold to
Eastern Air Lines, of Miami, which became a subsidiary of Texas Air
Corp. after filing for bankruptcy in 1989.
<p>
   Martin Brodie, a spokesman for Rolls-Royce Plc in London, said
the plane was fitted with Rolls-Royce RB211-535 engines. He said
the power plant was ``one of the most reliable engines in
service.''
<p>
   The company had no idea yet what went wrong and there was no
immediate evidence that the engines were to blame.
<p>
   The crash was the second of a 757 in less than two months. On
Dec. 20, an American Airlines jet crashed in the mountains near
Cali, Colombia, killing 160 of the 164 people on board. The cause
of that crash is still under investigation.
<p>
   The Dominican Republic, which shares the island of Hispaniola
with Haiti, is the most popular Caribbean destination for Germans.
Hundreds of thousands of German tourists visit the island each
year, attracted by its low prices and tropical beaches.
<p>
   Oeger is one of a number of discount tour agencies in Germany
which charters planes to the Dominican Republic.

<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  A Boeing 757 carrying 189 people, mostly tourists
on their way home to Berlin and Frankfurt from the Dominican
Republic, crashed into the Atlantic late Tuesday about 13 miles
offshore. At least 105 bodies were recovered, American officials
said.
<p>
   Debris was spread in an area two miles long and 150 yards wide,
the United States Coast Guard said, suggesting that the jet broke
up before it hit the water.
<p>
   But an official at the German Embassy in Santo Domingo, the
capital of the Dominican Republic, said the fuel had not caught
fire, indicating that the plane had not exploded.
<p>
   The official, the first secretary at the embassy, said bad
weather was likely the cause.
<p>
   ``More than 50 percent, it was the interference of bad
weather,'' the official, Klaus D. Brock, said in a telephone
interview. The plane had taken off from Puerto Plata, about 100
miles northwest of Santo Domingo.
<p>
   The crash was the second recent loss of a Boeing 757 in flight:
In December a 757 crashed near Cali, Colombia; pilot error appears
to have been the primary cause.
<p>
   Aviation officials in Puerto Plata gave conflicting information
Wednesday about the flight, which reached an altitude of about
7,000 feet before crashing.
<p>
   Gen. Hector Ramon, head of the civil aviation agency, said the
pilot had radioed the tower that he had a problem and was
returning, news reports said. But Maj. Emmanuel Souffront, of the
Dominican Air Force, said a transcript of radio communication with
air traffic controllers indicated there had not been a problem.
<p>
   ``The aircraft started to turn to the right and disappeared from
the radar screen,'' he was quoted as saying.
<p>
   ``Before it went down, someone radioed from the aircraft, `Stand
by.'''
<p>
   In Berlin and Frankfurt, friends and family of the passengers
arrived at the airports to find flags flying at half staff and
teams of doctors, psychologists and clergy to meet them.
<p>
   The 11-year-old plane, originally built for Eastern Air Lines,
was owned by a Turkish company and under lease, with a crew, to a
Dominican airline, Alas de Transporte Internacional, for a single
flight. It carried 176 passengers, including 4 children. Eleven of
the crew were Turkish and two Dominican.
<p>
   The Turkish company, Birgen Air, was using the plane to fill a
charter commitment to a German company, Oger Tours of Hamburg.
Wolfgang Schwalm, a spokesman for the Frankfurt airport, said the
Boeing 757 had replaced a Boeing 767 at the last minute because the
767 had technical problems.
<p>
   In Istanbul, the general manager of Birgen said on television
that he believed the plane had been hit by lightning. But the jet
is designed to withstand any such strikes.
<p>
   The United States Coast Guard dispatched three cutters to help
retrieve bodies. Germany sent two civil aviation officials and
three officials from the federal police in Weisbaden to help
identify bodies.
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said it would send experts
to assist investigators, and the National Transportation Safety
Board said it would send investigators if more evidence became
available.
<p>
   But it was not clear who would pay to retrieve the plane's data
recorder from the wreckage, off the north coast of the Dominican
Republic where the water is about 3,000 feet deep. Retrieval could
cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Though the plane was
American built, neither it nor the airline nor the flight was under
American jurisdiction, and no Americans were on board.
<p>
   Nevertheless, American safety experts said they would be very
interested in learning more about the crash if it was caused by
mechanical problems or by weather.

NAVY TO HUNT FOR BLACK BOX FROM AIR CRASH
(HLW)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   UPPER MARLBORO, Md.  &MD;  The Navy said here on Thursday that it had
shipped equipment to the Dominican Republic to help find the flight
data recorder of the Boeing 757 that crashed offshore on Tuesday
night, killing all 189 people on board.
<p>
   Navy officials said they had been asked to locate the so-called
black box, but so far have not been asked to help retrieve it or
any other parts of the wreckage. In the meantime, discussions
continued about who would pay to salvage parts of the jet.
<p>
   The Turkish-owned charter jet, which was leased to a Dominican
airline, was carrying German tourists home from a Caribbean
vacation when it plunged into the Atlantic shortly after takeoff
from Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic.
<p>
   Late on Thursday afternoon in Puerto Plata, the Coast Guard said
it had given up its search, and it remained uncertain exactly how
many bodies had been accounted for.
<p>
   Dominican officials said 128 bodies had been recovered. A
Pentagon spokesman said local people in boats appeared to have
stripped some bodies of money and identification.
<p>
   After the crash, the Dominican Republic asked for help from the
National Transportation Safety Board, which in turn called in the
Navy.
<p>
   Capt. Raymond Scott McCord, supervisor of the Navy's salvage and
diving operations, said at a briefing here on Thursday that the
Boeing 757 went down in an area where the water is from 1,000 feet
to 13,000 feet deep, with the sea bottom flat in some parts and
jagged in others.
<p>
   Although McCord said the Navy had retrieved wreckage in more
challenging places, he declined to predict the likelihood of
success in recovering the black box in this case, or what it would
cost.
<p>
   The black boxes on passenger jets are equipped with metal
cylinders that emit a ``ping'' sound when immersed in water.
<p>
   So far, the Navy has sent a Towed Ping Locator System, also
known as a tow fish, to the area. The device is pulled on a cable,
about 2,500 feet above the ocean floor, at 2 to 3 knots, and,
depending on water conditions, it can hear the pinger on the black
box at a distance of up to a mile.
<p>
   Navy officials and aviation experts plan to review air traffic
control radar and other data in an effort to narrow the search
area. When they finish, probably on Tuesday or Wednesday, they will
begin surveying the ocean, he said.
<p>
   ``Looking for anything on the ocean floor is very difficult,
because you are working blind,'' he said. ``The analogy is a needle
in a haystack. But with a pinger locator, you know which side of
the haystack you're looking at.''
<p>
   The Navy also showed off a bigger robot probe that would carry
out the next step, making sonar maps of the bottom, to locate the
debris fields. A third remote-controlled device, with video and
still cameras and manipulator arms, would then be sent down. All
three are towed by a ship, and the Navy is now negotiating with
commercial ship owners for a suitable vessel, McCord said.
<p>
   No one would say what such an operation would cost.
<p>
   At the National Transportation Safety Board, Michael Benson, a
spokesman, said, ``any costs are expected to be incurred on a
cost-sharing basis.''
<p>
   ``We certainly have a strong interest in that aircraft; it's our
aircraft,'' he said.
<p>
   ``There are others who have an equally strong interest,'' he
said, citing ``countries and corporate entities.'' These would
apparently include Germany, Turkey, the Dominican Republic, Boeing,
Alas de Transporte Internacional, which leased the plane, and
Birgenair, a small Turkish company that owned the plane and
provided the crew.

JET THAT CRASHED IN COLOMBIA REPORTEDLY STRIPPED OF PARTS
(HLW)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Scavengers have descended on the wreckage of the
American Airlines jetliner that crashed in Colombia last December,
making off with more than 500 parts, including the jet engines, the
landing gear, and electronic components for possible sale to other
carriers, the airline said.
<p>
   A spokesman for the airline said that to its knowledge, no parts
of the plane had yet been offered for sale, and on Thursday the
Federal Aviation Administration said it was notifying other
airlines of the possibility.
<p>
   Not long after the Boeing 757 jetliner crashed last Dec. 20 in a
remote mountain area near Buga, Colombia, killing 160 of the 164
people on board, the Colombian authorities said people were taking
valuables from the bodies of the dead passengers as well as the
luggage.
<p>
   Last month, the airline sent other airlines and aviation
companies an 11-page list of the missing parts and their serial
numbers along with a letter warning: ``These parts could pose a
significant safety risk should they be installed on other aircraft
since they were involved in a crash.''
<p>
   John Hotard, a spokesman for American, said by telephone: ``You
may have a part that looks perfectly good on the outside, but if
you get into some of the sophisticated testing, you may find out
it's not good.''
<p>
   Although the plane was a Boeing 757, flying from Miami to Cali,
many of the parts would also fit a Boeing 767.
<p>
   The airline's letter, first reported in The Cleveland Plain
Dealer, noted: ``Any part taken from the crash site and/or offered
for sale without the express written approval of American Airlines
Inc., should be considered a stolen aircraft part.'' It cited
sections of federal law that made such activity illegal and
threatened that any supplier caught handling any of the parts would
be barred from doing business with American.
<p>
   Hotard said that American was not interested in the salvage
value of the parts but that some could be sold for a lot of money
if passed off as being in good condition. Testifying before a
Senate aviation subcommittee last June, federal investigators said
various small parts of airplanes that are worth hundreds of dollars
in new condition, are available for a few dollars from scrap
dealers in the United States and may find their way back into
airplanes, although the parts are not suitable.
<p>
   The local Colombian authorities did retrieve the black boxes
with cockpit voice and flight data recordings, and technicians at
the National Transportation Safety Board in Washington have
analyzed them. The safety board and the Colombian authorities
recently said there did not appear to be any mechanical problem
with the plane before the crash.
<p>
   That means that the stolen parts would probably not be useful in
determining the cause of this crash. In some other crashes,
investigators have sorted through tons of debris to find components
that offer clues.
<p>
   Stealing parts from crash scenes is not new. When a Colombian
DC-8 cargo plane crashed on Feb. 5 in Asuncion, Paraguay, killing
23 people, local television showed a man stealing engine parts from
the debris, The Associated Press reported. In the United States,
crash scenes are usually cordoned off, in part to protect the
evidence and to prevent the spread of blood-borne infection.
<p>
   A spokesman for the Boeing Co., Richard F. Schleh, said the
company had helped American distribute its letter, which he
described as ``a very good precautionary effort.''
<p>
   Margaret Gilligan, the deputy associate administrator for
regulation and certification at the aviation agency, said the
agency did not believe that parts had been stolen from planes that
had crashed in this country, but she said the agency did not know
what happened abroad.
<p>
   William A. Machado, who heads an FAA program to investigate
aircraft parts that are counterfeit or come from unapproved
suppliers, said of the American letter: ``It's the first time I've
seen it, but I can understand their concern, because they really
didn't have a lot of control.'' Machado called the letter ``a
responsible action on their part.''

   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Navy imposed new restrictions Saturday on
pilots who fly the F-14 jet fighter, after three of the
trouble-plagued jets crashed in the last month, killing four Navy
airmen and three civilians.
<p>
   While the Navy said it had found no common thread in the recent
crashes, it announced that it had placed temporary limitations on
the speed at which F-14s could be flown, and on the use of
afterburners, which give a plane extra thrust by injecting fuel
into hot exhaust gases.
<p>
   All F-14 pilots will also be required to undergo refresher
safety courses before they are allowed to fly again, a requirement
that could keep some grounded for several more days.
<p>
   The Navy made the announcement as it ended a three-day worldwide
shutdown on operations of the carrier-based F-14 Tomcat.
<p>
   In recent years the Navy's fleet of more than 330 F-14s has
suffered a series of catastrophic accidents, including a crash on
Jan. 29 in which one of the early models of the fighter, an F-14A,
smashed into a residential neighborhood in Nashville, killing the
two-man crew and three civilians on the ground.
<p>
   On Feb. 18, one of the latest models, an F-14D, went down off
the coast of southern California, killing its two-person crew.
<p>
   On Thursday, an F-14A crashed into the Persian Gulf; the pilot
and radar operator survived with only minor injuries.
<p>
   The F-14 has the highest accident rate among Navy combat planes,
and its problems have mounted even as the overall safety record for
Navy planes has improved dramatically in recent years. Ten F-14s
have gone down in the past two years, and 32 since 1991. Each plane
costs more than $30 million.
<p>
   In announcing the three-day halt to operations last week, the
Chief of Naval Operations, Adm. Jeremy M. Boorda, said that the
F-14 was ``an airplane that we worry about.'' Earlier models of the
plane had engines that were not powerful enough for a fighter of
its size, which led to restrictions on their use and, in some
cases, replacement of the engine.
<p>
   In a statement Saturday, the Navy said that the new restrictions
on speed and on the use of afterburners would remain in effect
until the investigations of the three recent crashes had ended. The
statement did not rule out permanent restrictions in the future.
<p>
   ``It should be emphasized that the investigations continue to
determine causes and any permanent corrective action required,''
the Navy said. ``The requirements and limitations placed in effect
today are intended to permit safe operation of the F-14 aircraft
pending completion of the investigations.''
<p>
   Under the restrictions, F-14 fighters cannot fly more than 550
nautical miles an hour, below an altitude of 10,000 feet.
Restrictions on the use of afterburners apply to later models of
the plane.
<p>
   Navy officials said Saturday that the restrictions would not
affect the plane's usefulness, since the limitations would be
immediately waived in combat. ``If a pilot is out there and needs
to fly his airplane, he's going to fly his airplane as he needs
to,'' said a Navy spokesman.
<p>
   The House National Security Committee has announced that
hearings would be held next week on the safety record of the F-14.
The panel is expected to hear testimony from Navy officials, pilots
and representatives of the manufacturer, the Grumman Corp., which
merged with Northrop in 1994.
<p>
   The two House Republicans who are sponsoring the hearings,
Duncan Hunter and Randy Cunningham, both from California, said in a
statement that ``too many lives and too much equipment has been
lost'' in F-14 crashes. Although the plane's problems precede the
Clinton administration by many years, the lawmakers said that they
planned to investigate whether the administration ``is underfunding
both the readiness and modernization of Navy aircraft.''

RARE TESTING ON A 737 SEEKS ELUSIVE ANSWERS TO A CRASH
(bl)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Air safety investigators have begun highly unusual
tests on a parked Boeing 737, forcing parts askew with hydraulic
arms and clipping vital control cables in an effort to determine
why a sister plane owned by USAir fell out of the sky near
Pittsburgh in September 1994.
<p>
   The investigation of that crash, which killed all 132 people on
board, is already the most extensive in the history of the National
Transportation Safety Board. And in a way it is the most worrisome,
because the 737 is the most popular jet in the sky.
<p>
   The board finds the cause of almost all crashes by looking at
the wreckage, the flight data recorders, radar records and similar
evidence. But in this case, that has not been enough in this case.
<p>
   ``What we're doing to this airplane is unprecedented,'' said
James Hall, the safety board's chairman.
<p>
   Hall said investigators had already invested more than 50,000
hours of engineering time in trying to find the cause of the crash,
making the inquiry the longest and costliest in the board's 29-year
history.
<p>
   The 737 that crashed was approaching Pittsburgh when it abruptly
rolled to the left and plunged to the ground at 300 miles an hour.
<p>
   Investigators say that its trajectory through the sky can be
explained by a sustained swing of the rudder  &MD;  the moveable surface
on the vertical tail  &MD;  and by nothing else that they can identify.
<p>
   It is not clear, though, how the rudder could have
malfunctioned.
<p>
   So technicians have pulled the floor out of the passenger cabin
of the test plane, enabling them to see the cables that link the
pedals at the pilot's feet with the rudder in the back of the
plane.
<p>
   If the cables do not snap because of the forces applied to them
during the tests, engineers will cut them and measure the sound.
The goal is to try to duplicate sounds captured by the cockpit
voice recorder just before the crash, and to see what effect a
snapped cable might have had on the plane.
<p>
   The investigators are using a plane that USAir had removed from
service and is planning to donate to the Museum of Flight, in
Seattle. The museum is across a runway from a Boeing plant, and
Boeing is assisting in the new experiments.
<p>
   The plane that crashed carried an early-model flight data
recorder, which captured only 11 kinds of data. It did not record
the position of the rudder or of the rudder controls. In contrast,
newer data recorders capture dozens of kinds of data, and usually
point investigators toward the root of the problem very quickly.
<p>
   For example, the recorder in the Boeing 757 that crashed off the
coast of the Dominican Republic last month had 72 kinds of data.
<p>
   Speaking by telephone from Seattle as the tests began Thursday,
Hall said, ``I just hope the aircraft industry and the Federal
Aviation Administration will take appropriate action so we are
never in a position again where it would take us this much time and
effort.''
<p>
   But the airlines argue that wiring planes to capture more data
would require taking them out of service for long periods, at high
cost.
<p>
   The plane being used for the new tests has been extensively
outfitted with instruments. ``It looks like somebody on life
support,'' said Hall, referring to the bundles of wires that are
now attached.
<p>
   Investigators are looking for some combination of problems on
three systems that can move the plane: the main rudder-control
mechanism, a backup mechanism and a yaw damper, which is a
computer-operated automatic system that makes small adjustments in
the rudder to keep the plane's nose and tail lined up in precisely
the direction that the plane is moving.
<p>
   One reason for the new tests is that investigators say they may
not fully understand the significance of an event that occurred
just before the crash: the USAir plane ran over the wake of a
Boeing 737 flying 4.2 nautical miles ahead.
<p>
   Such wake encounters are common, but investigators think this
one may have put a force on the plane that somehow triggered a
fatal chain of events.

LATEST CRASHES RENEW CONCERNS ABOUT AVIATION SAFETY
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
By BILL VIRGIN
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SEATTLE  &MD;  Commercial aviation worldwide is off to a rocky start
in 1996, with two major crashes this month alone claiming 312
lives.
<p>
   Other forms of transportation aren't faring much better. In the
United States alone, railroad accidents have accounted for 19
deaths, 226 injuries and more than $62 million in damage, National
Transportation Safety Board Chairman James Hall said this week.
<p>
   And while crashes of airline flights get the most attention,
general aviation is usually deadlier. Last year, the NTSB says, 732
people died in general aviation accidents, compared with 175 deaths
from accidents involving scheduled U.S. airlines. For the worst
carnage, America's highways are still unrivaled, with 40,000 deaths
reported from motor vehicle accidents each year.
<p>
   Still, news of jet crashes renew questions and concerns about
aviation safety, particularly when it comes in spates and
particularly in a city like Seattle, home to the world's biggest
manufacturer of commercial jet aircraft.
<p>
   The crash of a passenger jet anywhere ``is something that
galvanizes attention,'' said John Nance, an aviation safety expert
and writer.
<p>
   The latest crash  &MD;  that of a Faucett Airlines-operated Boeing
737 in Peru, which killed 123 aboard  &MD;  came on the heels of an NTSB
news conference in Seattle this week detailing its lack of success
in finding a cause for two U.S. crashes of Boeing 737s, one in
1991, the other in 1994.
<p>
   Those two crashes are linked by the remaining mystery of the
cause, the fact both involved 737s and the suspicion both crashes
may be linked to a sudden movement of the rudder, sending the
planes into uncontrollable rolls.
<p>
   But there seems to be little commonality in the three most
recent crashes, either by plane type or suspected cause. The crash
of an American Airlines Boeing 757 in Colombia in December, which
killed 160 people, occurred as the plane was approaching the
airport; pilot error is suspected.
<p>
   A Feb. 6 crash of a Birgen Air-owned Boeing 757 occurred as the
plane was taking off from the Dominican Republic; that crash
claimed 189 lives. Authorities in the Dominican Republic say the
recorded air speed indicator at the time the plane stopped climbing
was much higher than what ground radar showed, which would suggest
pilots thought they were going faster  &MD;  and had more power to climb
 &MD;  than they actually did.
<p>
   The investigation has just begun in the Peru crash, but some
witnesses say the plane was on fire before it hit the ground.
<p>
   Nance said there's no apparent common thread running through
those three accidents. ``The only other common denominator (would
be) the human factor, and it's been known for a long time that
human factors account for 90 percent of accidents,'' he said.
``It's still the thing that gets us. We're getting better at it,
but we're not as perfect as the machines we build.''
<p>
   Boeing has assisted in the investigation of the Dominican
Republic crash and spokesman Russ Young said a team is being sent
to Peru.
<p>
   Until the Colombia crash, the 757 hadn't been involved in any
fatal crashes in its 13 years of flying. The 737, which in various
models has been in service for 28 years, is the world's
best-selling commercial aircraft.
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration hasn't issued any directives
in relation to the three most recent crashes. ``It's way too early
for that,'' said FAA spokesman Tim Pile. ``We would need some kind
of formal finding, unless it was really obvious there was some
problem with the aircraft.''
<p>
   Last year, the International Civil Aviation Organization
reported, there were 26 accidents involving scheduled aircraft,
resulting in 710 fatalities; that was down from 941 the year
before.

TWO PRIOR CRASHES OF 737S STILL UNSOLVED
(With CRASH-BROWN-NYT)
(HLW)
By MATTHEW L. WALD
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  The Air Force plane that crashed in Croatia on
Wednesday was a modified version of the Boeing 737, a widely used
aircraft with one of the best safety records in the air. But two
unexplained crashes in the last five years, in Pittsburgh and
Colorado Springs, have raised questions about the 737's
performance.
<p>
   Like the plane that crashed on Wednesday, those aircraft crashed
while approaching airports for landing. But it is not known if
there are any similarities between the crashes in the United States
and the crash in Croatia.
<p>
   The investigators in the crash on Wednesday may be lacking one
basic tool available to those probing the civilian crashes. The Air
Force public affairs office at the Pentagon said that the plane,
like many of its aircraft, did not carry a cockpit voice recorder
or a flight data recorder, which are commonly known as black boxes.
However, a spokesman for the U.S. European Command, in Stuttgart,
Germany, contradicted that, saying such equipment was aboard.
<p>
   The Pittsburgh crash, of a USAir flight from Chicago that
crashed on an airport approach in 1994, is the most intensively
studied crash in the history of American civil aviation, but safety
experts still do not know what caused it. The Colorado Springs
crash, in 1991, is also unexplained; transportation officials hope
the investigation of the Pittsburgh crash will help explain it.
<p>
   The 737 is the single most popular commercial jet, and it makes
up about a quarter of the American airline jet fleet. Boeing has
sold over 1,100 of the 737-200s, the model that crashed on
Wednesday, and over 2,800 of all types of 737s, with 500 more on
order.
<p>
   The Air Force bought 19, including the one that crashed on
Wednesday, for $5.4 million each, and they were delivered in 1973
and 1974. Most are used for training navigators. Until Wednesday,
the Air Force had never had a crash involving the planes, or indeed
any incident that resulted in a death or permanent disability.
<p>
   The plane that crashed had recorded 12,000 landings and 17,000
hours of flight, which made it a relatively young aircraft, said
Maj. Laura J. Feldman, a spokesman for the Air Force. The plane was
flying from Tuzla to Dubrovnik, a 45-minute trip.
<p>
   Among the characteristics that make the 737 desirable for the
Air Force is its ability to operate from short, rough airfields.
<p>
   The plane that crashed, called a T-43 by the Air Force, was set
up to carry about 60 passengers. It had fewer windows than the
airline model and some extra electronic equipment protruding from
its stubby, 100-foot-long body.
<p>
   The plane had been used in Bosnia in recent weeks to ferry
American and NATO dignitaries to and from airports where many
runways have been scarred by civil war. Air Force officials say
that Secretary of State Warren Christopher flew aboard the plane
during a visit to the Balkans earlier this year.
<p>
   The plane had been used earlier this week to ferry Defense
Secretary William Perry on trips within the Balkans  &MD;  from Zagreb,
the Croatian capital, to Tuzla and Sarajevo in Bosnia, and then to
Tirana, Albania, and from Albania to Cairo on Tuesday. Military
officials said that the plane then returned to Zagreb to pick up
Commerce Secretary Ron Brown and his delegation.
<p>
   For security, the crew minimized time at low altitudes, to limit
the possibility of the plane being hit by gunfire or shells fired
by rebel forces, according to officials.
<p>
   The plane, clearly marked with a U.S. flag on its tail and the
bold lettering ``United States of America'' on its side, was based
at Ramstein Air Base, in Germany, as was its crew. The civilian
version has a crew of three; the Air Force said that the plane that
crashed had six crewmen on board.
<p>
   Investigators working on the Pittsburgh crash say they believe
that the aircraft's trajectory on Wednesday can be explained only
by a sudden, full swing of the rudder on its tail, but the parts
that survived the wreckage do not provide any physical evidence
that this actually occurred, and the flight data recorder was not
sophisticated enough to record the information.
<p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, the independent
federal agency in charge of investigating civilian aircraft
accidents, hopes to finish the investigation and reach a conclusion
this year.
<p>
   Apart from Colorado Springs and Pittsburgh, the agency has only
three unsolved crashes in its 29-year history.
<p>
   The Safety Board is sending several investigators with the
military team to look into the crash.

PLANE'S CRASH AGAIN RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT ITS CIVILIAN COUSIN, THE
737
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)
(With BROWN-CRASH)
By T.M. SELL
c.1996 Seattle Post-Intelligencer
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The jet that crashed Wednesday with U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron
Brown and 32 others aboard was a military derivative of the Boeing
737  &MD;  similar in many ways to the civilian model but different in
that it had no in-flight voice or data recorders.
<p>
   Boeing sold 19 of the T-43 models to the U.S. government in
1973-74 for use as trainers. A couple, like the one that crashed
Wednesday, were later refitted to carry passengers.
<p>
   The T-43 is basically a 737-200 model with a reinforced floor to
support training equipment and with fewer windows. Most of the
fleet is involved in training flight navigators for other U.S.
military aircraft, stationed at Air Force bases around the United
States. The plane that crashed was stationed at Ramstein Air Force
Base in Germany as part of the 76th Airlift Squadron.
<p>
   The tragedy again raises questions about the 737, if only
because the well-traveled jetliner has been involved in a pair of
unsolved crashes in recent years. A March 3, 1991, crash of a
United Airlines 737 near Colorado Springs killed 25 people. The
Sept. 8, 1994, crash of a USAir 737 near Alequippa, Pa., in which
132 people died, remains under investigation.
<p>
   In both accidents, the aircraft rolled sharply and crashed.
Federal investigations into the crashes have centered on
unexplained movements of the rudder. About a dozen such incidents,
not involving crashes, have been recorded on 737 flights.
<p>
   U.S. Air Force and Boeing representatives said they have no
immediate explanations for Wednesday's crash in the coastal
mountains of Croatia. The 22-year-old aircraft had modern safety
equipment and was certified for instrument flying in the type of
stormy weather reported in the area at the time of the crash.
<p>
   Boeing spokesman Russ Young said the company will send experts
to support the Air Force's investigation of the crash.
<p>
   That investigation will be hampered by the T-43's lack of the
``black box'' recorders that are standard equipment on commercial
jets. Air Force Maj. Felicity Tavares said the T-43 was equipped
only with a ground-proximity warning system and standard commercial
navigational aids.
<p>
   The airplane had logged about 17,000 hours of flying time and
had 12,000 take-off and landing cycles. Boeing officials say that's
not much by normal commercial standards, and especially not for a
737, which is designed for frequent, short-haul service.
<p>
   Aerospace industry officials say the crash underscores the
challenge facing modern aviation, to reduce the number of crashes
even as the number of flights increases.
<p>
   The challenge is particularly acute for the 737. With more than
2,600 jets in service and more than 3,300 ordered, the 737 is the
world's best-selling jetliner. Boeing executives and many observers
argue that, considering its tremendous number of flights in all
conditions, the 737 is as safe as any aircraft.
<p>
   Tim Neale of the Air Transport Association, which represents
U.S. airlines, said that the incidence of accidents has fallen by
half over the past 15 years. But the rising number of flights makes
it sometimes appear that the chance of a crash is increasing.
<p>
   From 1979 to 1994, the number of fatal accidents was 1 per 1.8
million flights, Neale said, vs. 1 per 814,000 flights from 1963 to
1978.
<p>
   Bob Robeson, vice president of civil aviation for the Aerospace
Industries Association, a manufacturers' group, said the
improvements have flowed from advancements in technology as well as
training.
<p>
   ``Controlled flight into terrain'' was a leading cause of
crashes until the advent of the ground-proximity warning system,
which tells pilots when they're too close to the ground, Robeson
said.
<p>
   ``Human factors''  &MD;  such as improved training, improved
flight-deck design and improved maintenance  &MD;  also have played a
large role in improving safety, he said.
<p>
   Still, the severity of air crashes, no matter how rare, makes
the safety issue one of constant concern. Industry officials
acknowledge that if the public doesn't think it's safe to fly,
they'll be out of business.

GIRL, FATHER, INSTRUCTOR KILLED IN PLANE CRASH
(For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   SAN FRANCISCO  &MD;  A 7-year-old Pescadero, Calif., girl's dream of
making history by flying coast-to-coast in both directions ended in
tragedy Thursday morning when her light plane crashed in a
Cheyenne, Wyo., rain, hail and snowstorm, killing her, her father
and her flight instructor.
<p>
   Jessica Dubroff, her father, Lloyd Dubroff, 57, a San Mateo,
Calif., corporate consultant, and her flight instructor and
co-pilot, Joe Reid, 52, all perished when the four-seat Cessna
Skyhawk went down in a residential neighborhood seconds after it's
7:24 PDT takeoff in heavy rain, mixed with light hail and snow.
<p>
   ``We don't have any details except we are not expecting any
patients,'' said Ginger Humphrey, a spokeswoman for United Medical
Center.
<p>
   Witness Tom Johnson, a pilot, said it appeared the pilot was
trying to return to the airport in the face of the rapidly
developing storm when ``it stalled over my building, winged over
and went straight into the ground like a dart.''
<p>
   ``I kept thinking, `Please, please get some altitude,''' Johnson
said, saying the plane never got more than 400 feet off the ground.
``It just went right into the ground. I knew no one survived. It
would have been impossible.''
<p>
   It was not immediately known who was at the controls, said
Cheyenne police spokesman Dick Royce. But the ground rules for the
record attempt were that Reid was to touch the controls only in an
emergency and Dubroff was to ride in the back seat.
<p>
   Federal Aviation Administration spokesman Mitch Barker in
Seattle said the small plane crashed about a mile north of the
airport after taking off to the west.
<p>
   ``It went in nose first,'' said Dawn Salyards, a resident of the
area. ``From the looks of it you could tell, pretty much right
away, that there would be no survivors.''
<p>
   It barely missed one house, landing at the end of the driveway,
witnesses said. Debris was scattered throughout the neighborhood in
this quiet prairie city of about 50,000. The FAA and police said
fuel spilled but there was no fire.
<p>
   Within 20 minutes of the crash, a tarp had been placed over the
plane. The only sections visible were the tail and wings, which
were crumpled.
<p>
   Mike Benson, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety
Board, which investigates 2,000 plane crashes a year, said a team
was enroute from Seattle to probe the crash.
<p>
   ``We will be looking at all aspects of the accident, from the
human factors to the mechanical,'' he said.
<p>
   Certain to be a focus of the investigation was the stunt itself,
the type of flight  &MD;  and pilot  &MD;  many air safety experts say should
be discouraged.
<p>
   ``The Guinness Book of Records'' had ceased recognizing the
``youngest pilot'' category for fear of encouraging unsafe flights.
<p>
   The FAA's Barker, would not comment on the potential danger of
such record-breaking attempts. ``The FAA was aware that there was a
record attempt being made by the 7-year-old,'' he said. ``This is
not the first time something like this has been attempted by
minors.
<p>
   ``The FAA's position is that the flight instructor is in
control. The 7-year-old was considered a passenger (and) was not
considered to be in control of the plane.''
<p>
   The minimum age for a pilot's license is 16.
<p>
   Before the flight, Jessica's father said the girl ``dragged her
mother and me into this'' and was not pushed by parental ambition.
<p>
   ``If she can do this, she can do anything,'' he said. ``And it
will expand her horizons. She's going see the country slide by
under her wing at 150 knots ... and she's going to be able to say,
`I did that.'''
<p>
   A man who answered the Reid home telephone in Half Moon Bay,
Calif., shortly after the crash, said, ``I'm sorry, we're not
making any comments right now.''
<p>
   The Dubroff home telephone was not answered.

REPORT RELEASED ON INDIANA CRASH THAT KILLED 68

<TEXT>
<p>
   Eighteen months after an American Eagle turboprop plane crashed
in Roselawn, Ind., killing all 68 people aboard, the Federal
Aviation Administration issued its answers this week to one series
of questions raised by the accident. And Monday, the agency begins
addressing new questions raised by the very same crash.
<p>
   Since the Roselawn crash, the agency has worked to gain a better
understanding of the effects of flying in icy weather, in
particular a rare condition in which tiny droplets of water are
suspended in the atmosphere below freezing temperature.
<p>
   When those liquid droplets strike a surface like an airplane
wing, they freeze on contact. Investigators believe a ridge of ice
formed on the wing of the American Eagle turboprop  &MD;  an ATR-72  &MD; 
causing it to tilt uncontrollably and crash.
<p>
   Thursday, the FAA issued a series of so-called airworthiness
directives affecting 29 types of turboprop aircraft  &MD;  the kind
typically used by regional commuter airlines  &MD;  that have a long
rubber bladder along the leading edge of their wings to crack and
shed ice.
<p>
   The regulations instruct pilots to look for signs of ice
accumulating on windows, wings or propeller hubs. If they see it,
they are supposed to change altitude or direction quickly.
<p>
   To reach that relatively simple ruling, however, required an
enormous amount of testing of these aircraft by the aviation agency
and their manufacturers.
<p>
   Those tests included measuring the tilting forces created while
taxiing at high-speeds with wooden shapes attached to the wings. In
addition, some aircraft were flown behind a tanker plane, which
sprayed them with water to see how they would perform in such
conditions.
<p>
   The aviation agency has determined that the French-made ATR
aircraft were the only turboprop commuter planes now flying in the
United States that required a design modification.
<p>
   The manufacturer, Avions de Transport Regional, with the
agency's approval, agreed to enlarge the rubber bladder along the
leading edge so that it covered more of the top of the wing. An ATR
spokeswoman said the company had modified the wings of all its
aircraft worldwide that flew in conditions where such icy weather
might occur.
<p>
   Anthony J. Broderick, the agency's associate administrator for
regulation and certification, said that because the tests were so
rigorous, he was confident that a crash like the one in Roselawn
would not occur again.
<p>
   ``We have closed the door on the safety issues,'' he said. He
added that since Roselawn, no airlines or pilots had filed reports
on planes upset in icy weather.
<p>
   Even so, questions about icy weather remain, and many of them
will be discussed starting Monday during a three-day conference on
in-flight icing at Springfield, Va. About 400 aviation experts from
the United States and many foreign countries are expected to
attend.
<p>
   Those and other discussions may lead, in months or even years,
to new standards that manufacturers must meet before the aviation
agency certifies their aircraft.
<p>
   The current standards have been in place since the 1940s, and
were not changed after a review in the 1960s. In broad terms, those
standards take into account most weather conditions that occur most
of the time.
<p>
   But as more turboprops fly more frequently, the chances of
encountering the rare but hazardous condition known as
``super-cooled drizzle drops'' rises.
<p>
   Broderick said his agency's goals included developing better
ways to forecast these conditions and possibly develop equipment to
alert pilots that they are flying in such conditions. Generally,
these conditions occur in relatively narrow bands in the sky, and
experts say that changing altitude by 2,000 or 3,000 feet is often
enough to escape the situation.
<p>
   The aviation agency is currently spending about $400,000 a year
on research into the problem. Broderick said the agency also
planned to start testing some smaller aircraft that are not used by
commercial airlines but that do use the rubber de-icing system.
<p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
accidents, is expected to issue its conclusions about what caused
the Roselawn crash within two months.

HELICOPTER CRASH KILLS 14 MARINES
(inserts new material after 3rd graf to give some of victims'
names)

c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   CAMP LEJEUNE, N.C.  &MD;  Fourteen marines were killed and two were
injured before dawn Friday when two helicopters collided and
plunged into a densely forested marsh in an isolated part of this
Marine Corps base in eastern North Carolina.
<p>
   The cause of the crash, which happened at 2 a.m. during a huge
U.S.-British amphibious-assault exercise, is still under
investigation, officials said.
<p>
   Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition at Pitt
County Memorial Hospital in Greenville, N.C., and the other was
listed in serious condition at the base hospital. No British troops
were involved in the crash.
<p>
   The Associated Press reported that officials at the base
identified three of the dead as First Lt. Arthur J. Schneider of
Livingston, N.J.,; Maj. Michael D. Kuszewski of Fort Devens, Mass.
and Capt. Scott T. Rice of Springfield, Mo.
<p>
   By midafternoon 11 bodies of the crash victims had been
recovered from the scene. But it took until about 4:30 p.m. for the
final three bodies to be recovered from the muddy and wooded area
where rescuers toiled for more than 16 hours. It was an indication,
a marine spokesman said, of the conditions in the forest.
<p>
   The search was hampered as tractors sank up to their tread tops
in the muck and rescuers resorted to cutting pathways with
chainsaws and fashioning walkways over the shifting ground with
slabs of plywood.
<p>
   ``It is very thick pine forest and swamp,'' said Maj. Steve
Little, a spokesman. ``It has been difficult, especially difficult
before dawn as we began the recovery. It has been made easier with
more light.''
<p>
   Little said the marines were part of a joint exercise including
38,200 U.S. troops and 15,600 British troops. The helicopters
involved were an AH-1W Super Cobra attack helicopter with a
two-person crew and a CH-46E Sea Knight, an assault and transport
helicopter that can carry as many as 22 people in addition to its
crew of four.
<p>
   The helicopters had taken off earlier that night from ships
massed off the North Carolina coast and headed inland to where the
accident occurred near the Courthouse Bay boat basin at the
150,000-acre military base.
<p>
   Flight operations in the British-U.S. exercises were suspended,
although surface operations would continue, Little said.
<p>
   Friday's accident was deadliest for the Marine Corps since 1989,
when 14 people were killed in the crash of another Sea Knight off
Okinawa. More than twice as many marines have died in aviation
accidents in the last eight months as were killed in such accidents
in the previous two years. The total killed so far this year in
aviation accidents, counting Friday's deaths, is 19. In 1995 there
were six aviation deaths and in 1994 there were only three such
deaths.
<p>
   It was a Harrier jet crash here in 1993 that prompted the Marine
Corps to order a rare 48-hour suspension of all fixed-wing and
helicopter flights to conduct emergency safety checks. In that
year, 12 people were killed in aircraft accidents. As recently as
March the Marine Corps called another two-day halt to all aircraft
flights for emergency checks.
<p>
   Col. Joe C. Yannessa, commander of the rescue operation, said
the collision had occurred in midair over the densely pine-forested
marshland and rained debris over a 150 yard area. Yannessa said
rescue crews on foot and carrying nothing more than their packs and
hand-held fire extinguishers got to the section of swamp 600 yards
from the nearest road within 30 minutes of the crash. There were
several smoldering, but not intense, fires scattered throughout the
area, he said.
<p>
   ``The aircraft frankly is in such a state of destruction that
there are no identifying marks that we could see on the aircraft,''
Yannessa said. ``They were sunk 3 to 4 to 5 feet into the muck.''

109 FEARED DEAD IN EVERGLADES CRASH
By GEORGE BENNETT
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   MIAMI  &MD;  A ValuJet DC-9 jetliner headed for Atlanta with 109
people on board crashed in the marshy Everglades about 20 miles
northwest of Miami International Airport Saturday.
<p>
   Flight 592 plunged into a swampy expanse of sawgrass more about
10 miles from the nearest road in an area accessible only by
helicopter or airboat.
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Flight 592 was about
100 miles west of Miami when its pilot reported smoke in the
cockpit and turned to go back to Miami shortly after 2 p.m.
<p>
   An eyewitness said the plane dived nose down at a 75-degree
angle.
<p>
   ``Nothing could have survived that,'' said Daniel Muelhaupt, who
told CNN he was piloting a private plane with a student and was
about two miles from the DC-9.
<p>
   Muelhaupt said he first thought the plane was a smaller craft
practicing maneuvers. He saw no smoke or fire coming from the
plane, Muelhaupt said.
<p>
   His flying student, Rick DeLisle, told CNN the impact of the
plane created a mushroom cloud about 100 feet high.
<p>
   ``It just looked like a large trash bag was blown open,''
DeLisle said.
<p>
   The plane crashed into at least four feet of water and debris
sank into several feet of muck below, fire-rescue officials said.
<p>
   All that was visible from the air was flotsam spread over a
50-yard area.
<p>
   The crash site is about 20 miles northwest of the airport in an
area inhabited primarily by snakes, alligators and mosquitos.
Rescue workers put out a call for anti-venin as a precaution
against possible snake bites.
<p>
   ``Accessibility is extremely difficult,'' said Metro-Dade Lt.
Luis Fernandez.
<p>
   ``You cannot see the total fuselage,'' said R.D. Paulison,
director of Metro-Dade Fire Rescue. ``There were no tail pieces to
see. There were no wing pieces to see. There was nothing at all.''
<p>
   A sheen of highly flammable aviation fuel on the water hampered
initial rescue efforts and attempts to recover the plane's flight
recorder, or ``black box.''
<p>
   A National Transportation Safety Board investigator said the
recorder aboard Flight 592 was an older model that would not
provide as many clues to the crash as newer, more sophisticated
models.
<p>
   A plane crash in a swamp is one of the worst-case scenarios in
the rescue business, said John Wright, a special operations chief
for Palm Beach County Fire Rescue, which practiced such a rescue
last month.
<p>
   Between the waist-deep watery mud, sawgrass so sharp it can
slice rescue worker's gear and the alligators and snakes, access is
a nightmare, Wright said.
<p>
   Along the Tamiami Trail about 10 miles south of the crash site,
dozens of private airboat owners lined the road volunteering their
services to rescue workers. By nightfall, though, authorities had
sent them home, and police were turning away visitors.
<p>
   Rescue and recovery workers were setting up camp Saturday night
near the site along the levee of the L-67 Canal, hanging mosquito
netting and lights from their boats as they settled in for the
night.
<p>
   At Miami International Airport, about 50 or 60 family members of
Flight 592 passengers arrived in the first 2{ hours after the crash
and were shepherded to a private area where counselors and clergy
were on hand.
<p>
   It was the first crash of a commercial flight arriving or
departing at Miami International since December 1972, when an
Eastern Airlines L-1011 crashed in the Everglades approaching the
airport and 101 of 176 aboard were killed.
<p>
   It was the first fatal accident involving ValuJet since the
bargain airline began operations in October 1993.
<p>
   But ValuJet has had several safety problems over the last year.
<p>
   In June, an engine fire spread through the fuselage of a ValuJet
plane on the runway at Hartsfield International Airport in Atlanta,
burning a flight attendant and destroying the plane.
<p>
   Since January, three ValuJet planes have run off runways in bad
weather, and two planes have been knocked out of service after hard
landings. There were no injuries in any of those incidents.
<p>
   The Atlanta-based carrier began with two used planes in 1993 and
has expanded to about 50. But it announced last month it would take
a break from its rapid growth ``to concentrate on its product
integrity prior to the commencement of the Olympic Games,'' the
airline said.
<p>
   ``This decision has been made, in part, in response to increased
(FAA) scrutiny and requirements relating to the company that
resulted from recent incidents involving the company's aircraft,''
the airline said at the time.

1986 COMMERCIAL FLIGHT EXPERIENCED SIMILAR FIRE, EXPLOSION TO
VALUJET PLANE
EDs: With CRASH-MAIN.
By SIOBHAN MORRISSEY
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla.  &MD;  Half an hour after a mechanic jostled an
oxygen-generating canister aboard a grounded McDonnell Douglas
DC-10, the airplane began smoldering and then erupted into flames.
<p>
   Although no one was injured, flames destroyed the American Trans
Air jetliner shortly after it arrived from Honolulu on Aug. 10,
1986. A decade later, National Transportation Safety Board
investigators are exploring whether a similar fire could have
caused ValuJet 592 to crash into the Everglades, killing all 110
(CQ) people on board.
<p>
   ValuJet's cargo manifest listed five crates containing 50 to 60
of the stainless steel canisters that produce oxygen for emergency
masks. The devices were stowed near three inflated aircraft spare
tires.
<p>
   Robert Francis, the board's vice chairman, said the oxygen
generators may have exploded in the forward cargo hold.
<p>
   Such an explosion could account for why the air speed and
altimeter registered information that conflicted with radar reports
of how fast and how high the plane was traveling, chief
investigator Gregory Feith said.
<p>
   Similarly, the aircraft tires pose a potential problem for
in-air explosion. Former safety board chairman Jim Burnett
described the aircraft tires as ``very dangerous to be around
because they are under very high pressure  &MD;  if you are around one
when it blows it can kill you.''
<p>
   Sometimes tires that are part of the landing gear explode while
in flight but they do not damage the aircraft because a special
shield in the wheel well protects the aircraft, Burnett said.
However, the cargo hold lacks such shielding, he said.
<p>
   ``I've heard of tires exploding in the wheel well, but never ran
across the issue of them being transported in the cargo,'' he said.
``I rather suspect that's because they don't do it.''
<p>
   Other safety board officials registered concern about proper use
of oxygen generating systems as early as 1976.
<p>
   ``The potential for serious injuries and fatalities is great,''
an NTSB report said then, noting recurring problems with the
systems that chemically generate oxygen on DC-10s and Lockheed
1011s.
<p>
   The Department of Transportation classifies the oxygen
generators as hazardous materials when carried as company material
in cargo compartments. They should be packaged and stowed securely.
<p>
   Just as in the ValuJet case, oxygen generators were stowed in
the forward cargo compartment of the American Trans Air plane what
was demolished in the Chicago fire 10 years ago. An American Trans
Air mechanic apparently set off the fire that destroyed the DC-10
while attempting to fix an oxygen compartment door that would not
close.
<p>
   ``He found a loose oxygen canister and handled it improperly by
its oxygen hose,'' according to a safety board account of the fire.
That released the firing pin, which in turn fired the percussion
cap and triggered a chemical reaction that generated oxygen.
<p>
   Improper handling of the oxygen generating canisters -- such as
inadvertently releasing the firing pin -- can trigger a chemical
reaction and generate oxygen, which generates heat up to 430
degrees outside the canister. That's hot enough to explode hydrogen
and automatically inflate air bags in vehicle fires. Volcanic
eruptions that throw off ash and steam reach just over 400 degrees.
<p>
   The fire aboard American Trans Air began shortly after the
aircraft completed a flight from Honolulu. The passengers and crew
had deplaned the cleaning crew entered, noting the cabin was
initially cold and grew ``uncomfortably hot'' within minutes.
Within the next 30 minutes gray smoke began billowing in the
passenger cabin, forcing the cleaning crew to evacuate.
<p>
   ``The smoke grew darker and rapidly intensified,'' according to
a safety board account of the fire.
<p>
   The cabin then burst into fire, destroying the entire aircraft.
The fire ignited seat covers, burned through the cabin floor and
spread throughout the entire cabin.
<p>
   After the fire investigators tested a similar oxygen canister to
determine whether it could generate enough heat to cause the fire.
They wrapped the canister in a paper laboratory coat and pulled the
canister's pin. The coat ignited and burned.

SABRETECH SAYS IT DELIVERED MISLABELED BOX TO VALUJET (REPEAT)
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By Jeff Vinson
c.1996 Bloomberg Business News
   (Repeats story that moved late yesterday; adds comments from
Quinn in paragraphs 3-4)
Atlanta, May 20 (Bloomberg) -- SabreTech has opened an ``exhaustive
investigation'' into why its employees delivered to ValuJet Inc. a
box of oxygen generators marked as ``empty,'' said a spokesman for
the Miami aircraft repair facility.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ``We acknowledge that SabreTech delivered to ValuJet boxes
containing the canisters with a shipping ticket marked as`empty',''
said Dave Reddick, a spokesman for shipper's parent company.
``We're certainly concerned about this.''
<p>
   Kenneth P. Quinn, a SabreTech spokesman in Miami, said late
yesterday that his company, ``consistent with past practice,''
returned ValuJet materials to the airline for ``appropriate
disposal.''
<p>
   ``ValuJet made an independent decision to ship their company
materials on board an aircraft, and apparently did not ensure that
they were properly labeled, packaged and stored,'' Quinn said.
<p>
   ValuJet officials said the airline wasn't informed that cargo
flight 592 was hazardous.
<p>
   Hazardous materials experts investigating the May 11 crash of
the discount carrier's DC-9 in Florida's Everglades earlier this
month found evidence that exploding oxygen canisters in the cargo
hold may have caused the accident, which killed 110 people.
<p>
   The National Transportation Safety Board reported that divers
found metal fragments from oxygen canisters that apparently
exploded and burned before the plane crashed. Five boxes of oxygen
generators were presented for shipment to Atlanta from Miami by
non-ValuJet employees, and someone filled out the ticket to read:
``5 boxes, oxy canisters empty,'' ValuJet said in a statement. The
shipment was delivered to ValuJet in boxes without the federally
required hazardous material labeling or any other indication of the
hazardous goods within, ValuJet said. SabreTech removed the expired
canisters from three ValuJet MD-80 aircraft, the NTSB said. Two or
three months later, a SabreTech official ordered them returned to
ValuJet. Consistent with ValuJet's statement, NTSB lead
investigator Gregory Feith said the boxes were marked as company
material, the shipping manifest said the canisters were ``empty.''
<p>
   About 119 oxygen canisters were in the cargo hold, more than
double the amount originally thought, Feith said. No plastic safety
caps were used to cover the firing mechanisms on the canisters, he
said. ``We're cooperating fully with the NTSB, the FAA and
Department'' to find out why the box was mislabeled, Reddick said.
<p>
   Sabreliner, a St. Louis-based company that specializes in engine
overhaul and structural modification of government and civilian
aircraft, purchased SabreTech, formerly known as DynAire, last
year, Reddick said. He said this is the first time an incident like
this has happened at SabreTech. ``We are very proud of our very
good safety record, and we're doing everything possible to check to
see that the proper procedures are followed,'' Reddick said. On
Sunday, ValuJet President Lewis Jordan ask Americans to wait for
the results of the federal probe before abandoning the troubled
airline.
<p>
   ``We think it would be a tragedy for the American people who
can't afford high fares to not have ValuJet around,'' Jordan on ABC
TV's ``This Week with David Brinkley.'' ValuJet, based in Atlanta,
cut its number of daily flights in half during a special Federal
Aviation Administration safety inspection of its 51 planes. The FAA
has launched an ``intensive review'' of the airline, which follows
a special 120-day investigation that started last February after a
string of safety-related incidents.
<p>
   In trading today, ValuJet shares closed at 11 1/4, down 1 7/8,
the most active issue. ValuJet shares have fallen more than 27
percent since the crash.

COUPLE RECALLS JET'S FLAWS BEFORE CRASH
(sw)
By ROBYN MEREDITH
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  Just hours before Valujet Flight 592 crashed into the
swampy muck, Pamela Hettinger was sitting on the same DC-9, looking
out her window high above the Everglades and imagining a similar
fate, because she thought the plane was in trouble.
<p>
   She and her husband, Wayne Hettinger, were aboard the
27-year-old jet's next-to-last flight.
<p>
   On May 11, the morning of the crash, the Hettingers boarded
Valujet Flight 591 in Atlanta, bound for Miami. After a quiet
flight, the plane began its descent. Suddenly, she said, the cabin
lights went dark and the public address system failed. ``They had
to use a bullhorn to tell people to put their seatbelts back on,''
Mrs. Hettinger said. She remembers looking outside then with
visions of a plunge to her death.
<p>
   Within 10 minutes, Flight 591 had landed safely in Miami. But
Mrs. Hettinger, who flies four or five times a year and had flown
Valujet before without concern, said that she had tried to persuade
her husband to leave the plane with her even before they left
Atlanta.
<p>
   She became concerned, she said, after the airplane returned to
the gate twice before taking off. ``I know accidents happen, but I
just feel like that plane should have never left the ground,'' she
said in an interview on Tuesday. Hettinger echoed her account in a
separate interview.
<p>
   The Hettingers' recollections provide the first detailed public
description of the mechanical difficulties aboard the aircraft
hours before it crashed. While federal investigators are focusing
on the possibility that oxygen generators in the cargo hold caused
the crash, they have not ruled out other sources of the fire on
board, including wiring. Shortly after the crash, a Federal
Aviation Administration rule took effect requiring airlines that
fly DC-9's to check them for chafed wires in the cockpit.
<p>
   Other passengers on the Hettingers' flight could not be reached
for comment, and safety officials had few details about Flight 591.
A Valujet spokesman, Gregg Kenyon, also refused to discuss the
flight, saying, ``We are not able to talk about anything that
happened with aircraft 904'' after May 9.
<p>
   But Gregory Feith, the National Transportation Safety Board's
lead investigator for the crash that killed 110 people, gave a
brief account of Flight 591 at a press conference in Miami several
days after the crash.
<p>
   Before the jet took off from Atlanta ``there was a problem with
the circuit breakers'' for the fuel pumps, Feith said, adding: ``A
mechanic came on, thought that he had fixed it, and got off. The
problem had not been resolved and he got back on. The problem was
resolved and the aircraft departed.''
<p>
   Mrs. Hettinger recalled watching those events from her seat in
the second row of the aircraft in front of its left wing. After the
jet pulled back from its gate, she said, its lights went out, the
public address system stopped working and, moments later, the
engines clicked off. The plane restarted and returned to the gate,
she said.
<p>
   A mechanic boarded and went into the cockpit, then the cabin,
Mrs. Hettinger said. After he left, the plane again backed away
from the gate, Mrs. Hettinger recalled.
<p>
   Again, the cabin lights went dark and the public address system
failed. Flight 591 returned to its gate, and the mechanic
reappeared, stayed 15 minutes and left.
<p>
   ``The third time, we took off,'' Mrs. Hettinger said.
<p>
   The Hettingers learned after boarding a cruise ship in Miami
that the plane they had flown had crashed.
<p>
   ``That is when it made me a little weak-kneed,'' Hettinger said,
``because for the life of me I can't see why they ever left again,
with all that going on.''

WHISTLEBLOWER SHIELD: AVIATION WORKERS WANT PROTECTION WHEN THEY
REPORT TROUBLE
By MACON MOREHOUSE
c. 1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   ATLANTA  &MD;  Flight attendant Nancy Chagares says when she heard
that a ValuJet plane, just deemed unairworthy by a pilot, had taken
off with a new crew and passengers, she didn't hesitate to report
it to her supervisors.
<p>
   For her effort, she says, she was forced to resign.
<p>
   ``If you raise questions about anything, by God, they are going
to get rid of you,'' she says.
<p>
   A ValuJet spokesman said the airline investigated Chagares'
claims about the incident last New Year's Eve and did not force her
out of her job.
<p>
   But stories like hers have prompted aviation employees to fight
for the same protection thousands of other workers have: the
freedom to fight back legally if they are punished for blowing the
whistle.
<p>
   A bill pending in Congress would bar airlines and their
contractors from discriminating against an employee who reports
safety problems. Violations could be reported to the U.S.
Department of Labor or, eventually, a federal court.
<p>
   Supporters say they hope last month's fatal crash of ValuJet
Flight 592 helps speed passage of the law. A hearing before a
congressional subcommittee could be held as early as July 10.
<p>
   ``On any airline, if there are problems, it's the people working
on the planes who will see them,'' said Jill Gallagher, spokeswoman
for the Association of Flight Attendants. ``Relying on the workers
would be a good thing.''
<p>
   U.S. Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), who introduced the bill, said
the fatal crash of a USAir flight in Charlotte two years ago
prompted his concern.
<p>
   ``I take at least four flights a week,'' he said. ``For me to
sit there knowing a flight attendant is not on the team making sure
I am safe (because of a fear to report problems) is unbelievable.''
<p>
   ValuJet and Delta, both based in Atlanta, say they do protect
employees who report problems and have telephone lines that
employees can call anonymously. Both say they encourage employees
to talk to their supervisors and do not discipline them for
reporting problems.
<p>
   ``It's an open-door policy,'' said ValuJet spokesman Gregg
Kenyon. They also may report concerns to the Federal Aviation
Administration, but ValuJet prefers that they do not go to the news
media, spokeswoman Marcia Scott said.
<p>
   Valujet flight attendant Anna Wooten said on ABC's ``Nightline''
last month that ``flight attendants are afraid to say anything.''
When the reporter mentioned that she was still working for the
airline, she replied, ``Probably won't be after this interview.''
<p>
   Wooten currently is on maternity leave, Scott said.
<p>
   Chagares, a former Atlantic Southeast Airlines flight attendant,
said her problems began a little more than three weeks after she
started working for ValuJet.
<p>
   She said she was working in the airline's Atlanta operations
center Dec. 31 when a pilot came in and told the operations
supervisor that his plane needed several days worth of maintenance
and he would not fly it.
<p>
   The pilot was assigned to a different plane, she said, but 15
minutes later ``they boarded up the (first) plane with another crew
and they left,'' she said. She said someone asked if that was the
same plane that had maintenance problems and the supervisor
replied, ``It was the only one they had.''
<p>
   ``I don't know if what was wrong with the airplane was fixed,''
she said. ``If they can do two days' work in 15 minutes, they
really are a wonderful airline.''
<p>
   The next day, she told her supervisor and refused to fly again
until she got answers about what happened.
<p>
   ``We took her concerns very seriously,'' ValuJet's Kenyon said.
He said the airline investigated but found no records of
maintenance problems in the log books. ``We took her concerns very
seriously,'' he said. ``We found no discrepancies and nothing wrong
with the aircraft.''
<p>
   He added that Chagares ``was offered various counseling and did
not come back.''
<p>
   Chagares said she was told in early February to start flying or
they would assume she didn't want her job anymore.
<p>
   ``Nobody in that company will say anything, nobody,'' she said.
``That's why that whistleblower law is needed so badly.''
<p>
   While ValuJet's Scott said she was not familiar with the
whistleblower legislation, she said, ``Anything that provides the
airline and its people with a method of guaranteeing a higher level
of safety is great.'' .

HOUSE VOTES TO KEEP DRUNKEN BOAT, PLANE OPERATORS FROM HIDING
BEHIND FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY LAWS
By CHRISTI HARLAN
c.1996 Cox News Service
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   WASHINGTON  &MD;  Seven years ago this month, 22-year-old Deborah Ann
Rock died on Lake Austin when she was hit by the bow and propeller
of a boat that smashed into the idling boat in which she was
sitting.
<p>
   Rock's parents won a $500,000 award from an Austin, Texas, jury
against the pilot of the moving boat, John Greenway. But 3 1/2
years later, the Rocks have yet to collect a penny from Greenway,
thanks to the protection of federal bankruptcy law.
<p>
   That protection should not be available in future cases
involving boats and alcohol, the House decided Tuesday. By a voice
vote, members of the House closed a loophole in bankruptcy law that
shielded drunk pilots of boats and airplanes from liability for
accidents that hurt or kill others.
<p>
   ``In the past, watercraft and aircraft operators have had little
fear of punishment knowing that this loophole existed,'' said U.S.
Rep. Vernon J. Ehlers, R-Mich., the sponsor of the measure. ``With
this bill, the federal government will be doing its part to
supplement what the states . . . are doing to combat drunk boating
and flying.''
<p>
   Bankruptcy law currently allows debtors to cancel most of their
debts, with about a dozen exceptions. Those include federal taxes,
student loans and ``any debt for death or personal injury caused by
the debtor's operation of a motor vehicle'' while intoxicated by
alcohol or drugs.
<p>
   In at least three cases, including the Rocks' case against
Greenway, courts have wrestled with the question of whether boats
are ``motor vehicles'' and whether drunk drivers of boats should be
shielded from liability.
<p>
   ``I'm just stunned that it's a hard question,'' said Karl O.
Bayer Jr. of Austin, the lawyer for two other people who were in
the boat in which Rock was killed. ``I didn't even figure it would
be a close call.''
<p>
   But two courts have agreed with Greenway and his lawyers that
the 21-foot Supra powerboat he was piloting June 30, 1989, was not
a motor vehicle. Those rulings have kept Greenway from having to
pay the judgments won by the passengers and pilot of the other
boat.
<p>
   The legislation approved Tuesday will not affect the Rocks' case
against Greenway, but the case was one of three cited last November
by the House Judiciary Committee when it reported on the need for
the legislation changing the bankruptcy law.
<p>
   The crash occurred on Lake Austin near the Loop 360 bridge as
Rock, two other passengers and the pilot sat on an idle 18-foot
Maxum powerboat. Greenway's boat hit the Maxum from behind and
became airborne, striking and killing Rock and severely injuring
another woman passenger.
<p>
   The wreck happened about an hour before Texas'
boating-while-intoxicated law took effect. Greenway, whose
blood-alcohol level was between 0.09 and 0.11, was indicted on a
misdemeanor charge of criminally negligent homicide and pleaded no
contest to the charge in August 1990. He was sentenced to 30 days
in jail and fined $1,000.
<p>
   Greenway, now a lawyer in Austin, sought bankruptcy-court
protection shortly after a civil-court jury voted in December 1992
to award $500,000 in damages to Rock's parents and a total of
$300,000 to three other people who were on the boat with Rock.
<p>
   A bankruptcy judge in Austin ruled that Greenway could escape
liability for the judgments because a boat is not a motor vehicle
as described in bankruptcy law. That ruling was overturned in April
1995 by U.S. District Judge James Nowlin of Austin, who wrote that
he could ``see no reason why Congress would have been concerned
with drunk driving in one context and not the other.''
<p>
   Earlier this year, Nowlin's ruling was reversed by the 5th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, which said a boat is not a motor vehicle.
The attorneys for Rock's parents, from the Austin firm of Spivey,
Grigg, Kelly and Knisely, have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to hear
the case.
<p>
   Greenway, reached at his office, declined to comment.
<p>
   ``There's plenty I'd like to say,'' he said, ``but it's still in
court.''

RECOVERY VESSELS: VARIED HISTORY AND FUNCTIONS
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By DAVID L. CHANDLER
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Navy ships Grasp and Grapple were built to rescue or tow
ships or submarines in distress and to salvage sunken vessels, but
their work this week on the recovery of TWA Flight 800 is not the
first time they have been used to retrieve aircraft  &MD;  or even
spacecraft.
<p>
   Less than two months after it was commissioned, the Grasp, the
older of the two vessels, was used in 1986 to pick up pieces of the
space shuttle Challenger from the sea floor off Florida.
<p>
   The Grapple, commissioned a year later, was once used to recover
two F-14 jets that had crashed in 190 feet of water, although a
Navy spokesman declined to specify where or when this operation
took place. More conventionally, it has towed decommissioned
nuclear submarines to their final ports, it has towed three
minesweepers to the Persian Gulf before the Gulf War, and it helped
with harbor cleanup in the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo.
<p>
   The two ships working on the TWA effort off Long Island are the
most advanced salvage ships in the world, and they are outfitted
with the latest in equipment for surveying the sea floor,
supporting teams of divers and raising debris, the Navy says.
<p>
   For the TWA salvage, the ships' most important equipment are
Remotely Operated Vehicles, or ROVs  &MD;  small unpiloted submersibles,
connected by cables to the ship. The submirsibles carry cameras,
sonar and laser equipment, and claws to grab and retrieve objects.
They are controlled from the ship by operators who watch television
screens displaying the ROVs' sea floor view. They are capable of
diving to 7,200 feet, although the TWA operation is in relatively
shallow water, only 100 to 120 feet deep.
<p>
   Much of the technology they employ is relatively new. In
particular, the advent of the Global Positioning System satellites
should make it much easier for divers to locate precisely specific
targets that have been identified with the side-scan sonar used to
map the area. The system can pinpoint a location to within a few
feet.
<p>
   The robotic submersibles also carry advanced scanning systems
that use a narrow beam of laser light to locate objects on the sea
floor. A small moving mirror reflects the laser beam back and forth
across the bottom, as a light receptor builds up an image of the
debris field. The image is created one line at a time as the
submirsible is towed along, much as a computer's flatbed scanner
translates an image into digital data one line at a time.
<p>
   This is the first time the laser scanner has been used in an
actual salvage operation, said a Navy spokesman, Lt. j.g. Joe
Walker.
<p>
   But even with the best of equipment, the skill of the operator
can make a big difference, said James Bellingham, director of the
underwater vehicle laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. For one thing, in the murky environment of the sea
floor, it can be very difficult to get a sense of the scale of
objects located by the sonar or laser devices.
<p>
   To illustrate, Bellingham cited a research project he worked on
in New Hampshire's Lake Winnipesaukee. A submersible found an
object the researchers thought was a coffee cup. Pulled to the
surface, it was found to be a chamber pot. ``We couldn't gauge what
the size was by looking at the video,'' he said.
<p>
   Locating pieces of the aircraft on the ocean floor is difficult
enough; recovering them is even trickier, Bellingham said. ``It's a
tough thing to do, and very much depends on surface conditions,''
he said.
<p>
   There are three basic ways to recover objects: with a ``lifting
bag,'' a canvas bag that is placed around the object and filled
with air to cause it to rise to the surface; using an ROV to grasp
the object in its claws and carry it up; or attaching cables to it
and hoisting it directly to the ship.
<p>
   The ROV is by far the gentlest and the least likely to cause
further damage to the object, said Navy spokesman Walker.

BC-TWA-CRASH-MEGADATA-ART-2NDTAKE-NYT
BOHEMIA, N.Y.: agency's concern.
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Yet, in the case of the TWA crash, Megadata's records proved
invaluable to federal officials.
<p>
   After Keller's phone call, safety board investigators and FBI
agents went to Megadata's office to view charts and determine what
other aircraft were in position to see the final moments of Flight
800.
<p>
   Eyewitness reports are considered by aviation experts to be
extremely unreliable, and the Megadata information helped establish
whether the other pilots were in positions to see what they claimed
to see.
<p>
   Based on FAA radar scans that emanated from Riverhead,
Megadata's charts indicated that two aircraft  &MD;  an Army Black Hawk
helicopter and an Air National Guard C-130 cargo plane  &MD;  were
indeed in position to have observed the fireball.
<p>
   FAA radar systems of the type used in Riverhead send out pulses
of energy that are reflected off metal objects in the sky, making
blips on a screen. The systems also send out electronic queries,
asking the identity and altitude of planes with on-board
transponders  &MD;  special radios that can respond to the FAA queries
by emitting electronic identification codes one one-millionth of a
second later.
<p>
   Subtracting that microsecond and dividing by the speed of light,
the FAA knows the range, or how far away the plane is. By keeping
track of precisely where the circular-scan radar beam is pointed
when it asks the question, the FAA knows the direction, or bearing,
of the aircraft.
<p>
   Megadata's system simply eavesdrops. The main components are a
receive-only antenna, about 5 feet high, which can be miles from
the nearest airport, and a work station to process the data.
<p>
   Although the company is searching for more customers, the reason
some buyers have been willing to pay $250,000 or so for a Megadata
system can be traced to the tight FAA strictures on air-to-ground
communications.
<p>
   When a plane is below 10,000 feet a ``sterile cockpit'' must be
maintained with no work or conversation not directly related to
flying the plane. That includes a ban on talk by crew members to
dispatchers at their airlines.
<p>
   For incoming flights, the radio blackout can leave airline
ground crews in the dark about precisely whether a plane will
arrive in time to let passengers make connecting flights or whether
controllers have put the plane into a low-altitude holding pattern.
<p>
   And even if radio contact were permitted, when several dozen of
an airline's planes are to land within minutes of one another,
calling them all would be too time-consuming, according to Capt.
William B. Cotton, United's manager of air traffic and flight
systems.
<p>
   United has become Megadata's largest client, using the systems
in Chicago, Denver, San Francisco, Los Angeles and at Dulles
International near Washington.
<p>
   ``It's a very, very clever invention,'' Cotton said. With the
click of a mouse, he said, United's dispatchers can view all planes
aloft in the vicinity, or simply all United planes, or focus on a
single aircraft. The system gives ground crews an estimated time of
arrival that is more accurate than pilots or dispatchers have been
able to provide, Cotton said.
<p>
   If a plane is going to be late, United uses the system to
decide, for example, whether to hold other planes on the ground to
let passengers make their connections. If its plane is in a holding
pattern above 10,000 feet, the airline can also tell its pilot how
long the wait is likely to be to help decide whether to divert to
another airport  &MD;  information that the FAA generally does not
provide, Cotton said.
<p>
   Airport managers use Megadata's information mostly to enforce
noise-abatement ordinances.
<p>
   ``We get complaints all the time,'' said Ron Wilson, a spokesman
for San Francisco International Airport, which has used the
Megadata system to resolve hundreds of complaints in the last few
years.
<p>
   ``People say: `I saw a 747 come over my house at 500 feet. I
know it was 500 feet because I could see the pilots. I could read
the numbers. I could see the wheels.' ''
<p>
   Using the Megadata work station, Wilson said airport officials
could enter the location and the time into the work station and
quickly determine the facts. ``We can tell them, it wasn't 500 feet
 &MD;  it was 3,500 feet,'' he said.

MORE THAN 140 FEARED DEAD IN RUSSIAN AIRLINER CRASH IN ARCTIC

<p>
   OSLO, Norway  &MD;  A Russian jetliner carrying more than 140 people
 &MD;  mostly coal miners and their families  &MD;  crashed into a mountain
Thursday on the remote Arctic island of Spitsbergen in Norwegian
territory. There appeared to be no survivors, Norwegian authorities
said.
<p>
   The three-engine Tupolev Tu-154 owned by Vnukovo Airlines was
nearing the end of a flight from Moscow when it went off course
amid low clouds and struck Opera Mountain, a 3,000-foot peak six
miles east of Svalbard Airport at Longyearbyen, the island's main
settlement.
<p>
   The passengers were described as Russians and Ukrainians, most
of them workers for the Trust Arktik Ugol mining company. They were
a relief force for an equal number of miners and family members who
had been waiting at the airport to take the same jet back to
Moscow.
<p>
   Russia's ambassador to Norway, Yuri Fokine, said that up to 20
children were aboard the jet, but Norwegian authorities in touch
with the airline maintained that the passenger list comprised 125
adults and 4 children, in addition to either 12 or 14 crew members.
<p>
   Flight controllers reported losing radio contact with the jet at
10:15 a.m. At 12:06 p.m. a Norwegian search party in two
helicopters and a light plane found most of the wreckage on a snowy
plateau, officials said. The rear section of the jet had tumbled
down a cliff, causing a small avalanche.
<p>
   Five rescue workers who landed at the scene determined that
there were no survivors, then left three and a half hours later
because of thickening fog, Norway's Rescue Coordination Center
said. It said the temperature was in the high 30s.
<p>
   Fokine praised the rescue effort in an interview with Norwegian
television and added, ``There was no sign of life when the
helicopters arrived.''
<p>
   A Norwegian minister, Jan Hoifoedt, informed the group waiting
at the airport of the crash.
<p>
   ``The tears flowed,'' Hoifoedt told a radio interviewer. ``Many
had friends, work acquaintances and even some family members
aboard. It is a huge tragedy for so small a community.''
<p>
   Spitsbergen is the largest island in the Svalbard archipelago,
about 350 miles north of the Norwegian mainland. A 1920 treaty gave
Norway ownership of the archipelago, but the Soviet Union acquired
mining rights in 1935.
<p>
   Of Svalbard's population of 2,500, almost two-thirds are
citizens of former Soviet republics. They operate two mines  &MD;  in
Pyramiden and Barentsburg  &MD;  extracting some 600,000 tons of coal a
year, about twice the output of Norwegian mines.
<p>
   Investigators from Oslo and Moscow are not expected to reach the
crash site until Friday morning, when removal of the bodies is to
begin. The Norwegian government was also sending criminal
investigators, though officials said there was no immediate sign of
foul play.
<p>
   Early this evening a Norwegian helicopter crew managed to lift
two prefabricated cabins onto the plateau near the wreckage. From
there, two or three sentries were to make sure the site is not
disturbed during the night.
<p>
   ``There are about 2,000 polar bears on this island,'' said Rune
B. Hansen, the acting governor. ``We haven't seen any around here
lately but they are unpredictable and can suddenly be anywhere.''
<p>
   Though the number of air fatalities in the former Soviet Union
has declined in the last two years, it remains alarmingly high
compared to what it was during the Soviet era.
<p>
   When the Soviet airline Aeroflot was broken up five years ago,
many new air companies were created. Vnukovo Airlines is one of
dozens of these so-called ``babyflots,'' which have been plagued by
lack of cash and poor maintenance. Many if not most of the aircraft
in the Russian fleets are long past retirement age.
<p>
   An official at Vnukova Airlines in Moscow refused to comment
Thursday night on the crash.

VALUJET GETS PERMISSION TO FLY AGAIN
(bl)
By ADAM BRYANT
c.1996 N.Y. Times News Service 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday that Valujet
Airlines, grounded for more than two months after a deadly crash in
the Everglades, could start flying again under greater agency
scrutiny.
<p>
   The approval, one of two hurdles the airlines must clear before
resuming service, comes 10 weeks after the agency ordered a halt to
its operations because of systemic safety problems uncovered after
the crash on May 11 of a Valujet DC-9 that killed all 110 people
aboard.
<p>
   Valujet also received tentative approval Thursday to resume
flights from the Department of Transportation, which evaluates the
competence and safety record of an airline's managers as well as
the carrier's economic health.
<p>
   With the department's decision, a seven-day comment period
begins during which the agency will receive any objections to
letting Valujet resume service.
<p>
   It will review the objections, give Valujet a chance to respond
and then make its final determination. If Valujet clears this
second hurdle with no objections, it could be back in the air as
soon as next Thursday.
<p>
   Transportation officials, however, are likely to hear again
about Valujet from the Association of Flight Attendants, a union
representing flight attendants at the airline.
<p>
   The union has repeatedly complained to the transportation
department in recent weeks that Valujet's senior officers are not
fit to run a safe airline in large measure because of the lapses
found at Valujet.
<p>
   The department said Thursday that it had taken into account the
union's recent objections in making its tentative decision. A
lawyer representing the union, Robert S. Clayman, said Thursday
that the union planned to file more complaints.
<p>
   ``What the DOT has suggested today is that the men in charge of
the airline were in no way responsible for all of the safety
violations that caused their shutdown,'' Mr. Clayman said in an
interview. ``We thought it was one strike and you're out, not trial
and error.''
<p>
   John V. Coleman, director of aviation analysis at the
department, said in a conference call with reporters that the two
top officers of Valujet  &MD;  Robert Priddy, chairman, and Lewis H.
Jordan, president  &MD;  had good safety records over their long airline
careers. ``Nothing in their background suggests that they have been
noncompliant with federal regulations of any kind,'' he said.
<p>
   The aviation agency said Thursday that Valujet had been approved
to resume service with nine aircraft, and could quickly add up to
six more. Valujet had 51 aircraft in its fleet when the airline was
shut down June 17. The safety lapses that led to Valujet's
grounding were not directly linked to the cause of the crash.
<p>
   Since the grounding of Valujet, the airline had met the agency's
requirements for resuming service, including revising its
maintenance program and procedures, revising its organizational
structure and adding new maintenance and management personnel, and
retraining pilots and maintenance workers, the FAA said Thursday.
The airline also will initially fly only one type of DC-9.
<p>
   The FAA also said it would raise the number of inspectors
assigned to Valujet to seven from three, and closely scrutinize its
plans to expand once it resumes flying.
<p>
   Valujet executives said Thursday that they hoped to resume
service to Atlanta and four as yet unnamed cities in about two
weeks.
<p>
   The FAA appears to have changed its approach to speaking
publicly about the safety of Valujet. Immediately after the May 11
crash, top FAA and DOT officials declared Valujet a safe airline.
<p>
   When asked Thursday whether the FAA now considered Valujet safe,
Bill White, deputy director of flight standards at the FAA,
responded only by saying that Valujet was in compliance with safety
regulations.
<p>
   ``It's up to Valujet to maintain the safe operation of the
aircraft,'' he said.

OVERSIGHT FAULTED IN POLICE HELICOPTER CRASH REPORT
(For use by New York Times News Service clients)
By THOMAS C. PALMER JR.
c.1996 The Boston Globe
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   BOSTON  &MD;  &UR;  &LR; Top State Police officials were warned of management
problems within the air wing even before the February 1995
helicopter crash that killed two troopers and two civilians,
according to a report issued Friday.
<p>
   The final administrative report of the State Police on the crash
repeats the October 1995 findings of the National Transportation
Safety Board on the two contributing causes of the crash  &MD;  State
Police management's failure to provide adequate oversight of the
air wing, and fuel contamination from an poorly maintained facility
in Framingham.
<p>
   But the report adds explicitly that a third cause of the
aircraft's crash into a Memorial Drive boathouse in Cambridge was
``failure of the pilot to execute a proper autorotation,'' a safety
procedure designed to allow an emergency landing after engine
failure.
<p>
   The crash of the American Eurocopter ASTAR craft killed two
state police troopers and pilots, James Mattaliano and Paul Perry,
and two civilian employees of AT&AMP;T who were also aboard, Arthur
Howell and Michael McCarthy.
<p>
   Friday's report chronicled two instances in which warnings were
sent to State Police management pointing to problems in its
aviation wing.
<p>
   In one case, a civilian manager at Norwood Airport reported
observing ``a lack of training activity'' among the police unit and
reported complaints about ``training practices and
professionalism'' within the air wing.
<p>
   That manager, who is unnamed but is employed by a company that
is a defendant in a lawsuit resulting from the accident, met with
top State Police officials in 1993 to express his concerns.
<p>
   Although he recalls telling the officials, including Secretary
of Public Safety Kathleen O'Toole that ``pilots no longer seemed to
practice autorotations when returning from a mission as had been
past practice,'' neither O'Toole nor two state police majors who
attended the meeting recalled that specific warning.
<p>
   In addition to that manager's warning, in March 1994 Sgt.
Richard Welby, an air-wing pilot, wrote a report containing his
belief that officers were not being adequately trained in emergency
procedures. All pilots later received training, though a
recommendation for advanced training had been denied because of a
lack of funding.
<p>
   The report issued Friday said Welby's concerns were communicated
to Col. Charles Henderson, but Henderson ``does not recall
receiving the document.'' Henderson has since retired as head of
the State Police after being pressured to leave, in part because of
the fatal crash.
<p>
   One State Police lieutenant said that, although the wing met
technical training requirements, ``he did not feel that formal
training was up to the standards one would expect.''
<p>
   O'Toole issued a statement Friday, saying, ``My thoughts and
prayers go out to the families of the crash victims as they once
again relive the tragedy that befell us all. Although nothing can
be done to return those lost I am pleased with the comprehensive
nature of this report.''
<p>
   The report reviews significant changes that have been made since
the crash, and others that are planned.
<p>
   So far, aviation consultants have been hired to reorganize the
air wing, the Department of State Police is seeking additional
money to replace aircraft and ground facilities, more training has
been required of air-wing managers, and the Framingham fuel
facility has been permanently closed.
<p>
   The report ruled out any acts of sabotage, but it said that
among police management there was ``organizational confusion
resulting from a lack of designated responsibility'' for taking
care of the fuel facility.
<p>
   Water contamination in the fuel found in the system of the
wrecked helicopter ranged from 2.5 to nine times the allowable
limit.
<p>
   ``We have learned from this tragedy,'' says the report, signed
by Reed V. Hillman, State Police superintendent.
