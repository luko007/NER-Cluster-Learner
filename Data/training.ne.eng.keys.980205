<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has denied a request that top <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
commanders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1941</TIMEX> be absolved of blame for failing to be
on alert for the Japanese attack on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>, but the military
agreed that top <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> officials also must share the blame.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> study re-affirmed the conclusion of previous
government investigations that both Rear Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Husband E. Kimmel</ENAMEX>
and his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> counterpart, Maj. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Walter C. Short</ENAMEX>, ``committed
errors of judgment'' leading up to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 7, 1941</TIMEX>, debacle.
<p>
   However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> study made a bow in the direction of
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX>'s and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>'s advocates by criticizing top <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>
officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> for being ``neither energetic nor effective
in getting'' warnings to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> about alarming intelligence reports
that a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-Japanese rupture was just hours away.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> also failed to give <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> a heads-up that the
Japanese consulate in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> was tracking the precise location of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ships moored in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The handling of these warnings ``reveals some ineptitude, some
unwarranted assumptions and misestimates, limited coordination,
ambiguous language and lack of clarification and follow-up at
higher levels,'' according to the report by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Dorn</ENAMEX>, under
secretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> for personnel and readiness.
<p>
   However, ``to say that responsibility is broadly shared is not
to absolve Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> of accountability,''
the Dorn report said.
<p>
   The seven-month re-examination of why <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces were caught
off-guard by the Japanese attack was done at the request of Sen.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Strom Thurmond</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.C.</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Armed Services
Committee</ENAMEX>, and members of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> family.
<p>
   In the midst of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s commemorations of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50th
anniversary of the end of World War II</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> family asked the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> to restore <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> to their highest ranks
posthumously as symbolic recognition that they had been made
scapegoats for the mistakes of others.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> held four-star rank and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> wore three stars on the day
of the attack. Within two weeks of the attack, both men were
relieved of their commands and automatically demoted to two-star
rank. They retired from active duty <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early in 1942</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward R. Kimmel</ENAMEX>, one of Admiral <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX>'s two surviving sons and
a leader of the campaign to exonerate his father, said the Dorn
report confirms the assertions of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> families
that the responsibility should be broadly shared and not placed on
the shoulders of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> exclusively.
<p>
   ``This is very affirmative from the standpoint of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX>
family,'' he said. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorn</ENAMEX> did a fine job.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thurmond</ENAMEX> expressed regret that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> weren't restored
to their higher ranks but expressed confidence that further
historical study will restore the ``good names of these two men.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX>'s conclusion that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> also should share the blame
for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> is in line with recent historical scholarship
showing mind-boggling incompetence, power-plays, harmful rivalries
and clumsy communications among <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> officials in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to the bungled handling of intelligence reports,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> officials come under criticism in the Dorn report in
other areas.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX> notes that the get-tough policy of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin D.
Roosevelt</ENAMEX> administration toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>  &MD;  designed to persuade <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>
to rein in its military expansionism in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast Asia</ENAMEX>  &MD; 
included an embargo against oil exports to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> and the freezing
of Japanese assets in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer of 1941</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The report suggests that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">FDR</ENAMEX> backed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> into a corner.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX> also cites the ``muddied'' warnings that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> sent 10
days before the attack to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> about the imminence of war
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s failure to follow up its warnings to check to see
what the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> commanders were doing to prepare.
<p>
   The Dorn report noted that previous congressional, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX>
investigations had also ``properly recognized and criticized'' the
failures of senior <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> military leaders.
<p>
   On the other side of the ledger, the Dorn report says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> had a lot of intelligence that ``was sufficient to justify a
higher level of vigilance than they chose to maintain.''
<p>
   For example, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> knew that war with
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> was ``highly likely'' and that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> would strike the first
blow. And they knew that the attack ``could occur within weeks or
days'' because tension between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> had been
building. Both commanders had received a ``war warning'' from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late November</TIMEX> to be on the alert against a possible
attack.
<p>
   Both commanders also knew the Japanese liked to spring surprise
attacks, especially on weekends. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> also knew that his
intelligence staff had suddenly lost track of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s aircraft
carriers and that Japanese embassies and consulates had been
ordered to destroy their secret codes.
<p>
   The report also notes the confused assumptions that governed the
relationship between <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   For example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> had responsibility for long-range
defensive patrols around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>, but <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> apparently never
asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> exactly what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> was doing in that respect. This
was a key mistake in view of the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>'s fighter planes
needed a four-hour warning before they could get in the air and do
battle.
<p>
   In reality, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> was undertaking only minimal
reconnaissance, mainly because of a lack of airplanes.
<p>
   Nonetheless, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX> commanders didn't know when or where the
attack would come.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX> said higher alert by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX> ``might not have
discovered the (Japanese) carrier armada and might not have
prevented the attack, but different choices ... could have reduced
the magnitude of the disaster.''
<p>
   The attack killed 2,403 Americans and sank or damaged 18
warships.
<p>
   The bottom line: There's no basis to restore their higher rank.
Besides, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON" STATUS="OPT">Dorn</ENAMEX> noted, ``Retirement at the two-star grade is not an
insult or a stigma.''
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dorn</ENAMEX>'s decision was praised by both sides of the historical
debate over <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edward L. Beach</ENAMEX>, a retired <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> captain and author of a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>
book defending <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimmel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Short</ENAMEX>, praised the Dorn report for
``restoring their honor without promoting them by acknowledging
that others also were guilty. This paper removes the stigma in the
court of public opinion.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald M. Goldstein</ENAMEX>, a historian at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">University of Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>
who helped write the best-selling <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> history ``At Dawn We
Slept,'' also lauded the report.
<p>
   ``Given all that we've seen, we know it was on their watch. To
exonerate them, you'd have to go back and exonerate everybody who
screwed up at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>. If they had caught the Japanese, they
would have been heroes. But they didn't. And they were out there to
defend the place and they should have been ready.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Pilots flying in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan International Airport</ENAMEX>
have become so concerned about safety hazards like snow-slick
runways and taxiway signs obscured by drifts that they have
complained to their airlines and circulated a pilots' petition
blasting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> as ``inept.''
<p>
   ``Pilots of several major carriers are concerned about the lack
of markings and the condition of runways and taxiways,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul
McCarthy</ENAMEX>, chairman of the accident investigation board for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Line Pilots Association</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCarthy</ENAMEX> said he been told of the pilots'
concerns by air safety officials from at least three major
airlines.
<p>
   Meanwhile, a separate group of pilots has drafted a strongly
worded petition complaining to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico
Pena</ENAMEX> about the conditions.
<p>
   ``From our experience, it is obvious that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> is an inept
organization incapable of handling daily operations in a manner
that provides safety comparable to other major airports in the
Northeast,'' reads the petition, a copy of which was obtained by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">the Globe</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``While other major airports have effectively removed snow from
their surfaces, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX>'s inability to plow runways and taxiways
properly and in a timely manner leaves <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> an unnecessary
disaster weeks after a snowstorm.
<p>
   ``This poor operation places aircraft, ground equipment and
personnel in extremely hazardous conditions which compromise the
high level of safety which the airline industry constantly strives
to achieve,'' said the petition, which sources said has yet to be
sent to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pena</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX>, which owns and operates <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>, defended the attempts
to remove snow, saying crews are doing their best to keep the
airport open while maintaining safety.
<p>
   ``The conditions speak for themselves,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kinton</ENAMEX>,
director of aviation. ``If a pilot, prior to departure, wants to
view the runway firsthand, he can. And there has not been one
incident where a pilot refused to take the runway.''
<p>
   A regularly updated tape recording of field conditions makes
incoming and outgoing pilots aware of what signs are broken or
obscured by snow. Of the 50 mandatory signs at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>, 12 were not
working <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Are these conditions great?'' asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX>. ``Hell, no. But
the snow we've had is unprecedented.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said he will meet with chief pilots of the airlines <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next
week</TIMEX> and ask if they want <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> to close for longer periods of time
for snow removal.
<p>
   ``Our objective has been to keep the airport open. We do quick
plows on the runways and as a result, taxiways get hard-packed
before we can remove the snow.''
<p>
   But veteran pilots who are based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> say more than taxiway
conditions are deplorable.
<p>
   ``Finding your way around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> at night is an adventure,'' said
one pilot who spoke on condition neither his name or airline be
disclosed. ``I flew in there (<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>) <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and we were laughing
out loud in the cockpit at some of the sights.''
<p>
   Plows had buried illuminated taxiway signs, making it difficult
for pilots unfamiliar with the airport to follow air traffic
control instructions.
<p>
   With signs obscured, pilots have a hard time knowing where to
hold short of runways, increasing the chance of two planes
colliding on the ground.
<p>
   ``We're concerned about runway incursions,'' said one aviation
safety offical. ``The boundaries between runways and taxiways are
obscured.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said there had been no runway incursions. ``There have
been a couple of incidents where aircraft got stuck,'' he said.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last three days</TIMEX>, at least three planes have become
disabled at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> in incidents pilots attribute directly to the
weather.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental Airlines</ENAMEX> jet from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX>, went
into a snowbank after turning on to a hard-packed taxiway. A
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX> spokesman said the plane was moving at 7 miles per hour
when the nose wheel lost traction, causing the plane to run wide.
The left landing gear went into an unplowed area of the taxiway.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> flight slid into snow when
the jet blast of a departing aircraft pushed the nose wheel, and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Business Express</ENAMEX> aircraft that had turned on to a closed, unplowed
taxiway had to be pulled from a snowbank.
<p>
   ``These are very minor incidents and are not alarming to me,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX>. ``Things happen when you have conditions that are less
than optimal.''
<p>
   Pilots say other major northeast airports near water, such as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LaGuardia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newark</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>, have runways and taxiways that
are bare and dry, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>'s have hard-packed snow. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said
those airports &UR;  &LR; have had less snow <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this winter</TIMEX> than <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   It was not until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> that snow was removed from
around antenna arrays at the end of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>'s runways making the
instrument landing systems operational, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Culver</ENAMEX>. Without the landing
systems, pilots used non-precision approaches which resulted in
delays because planes were spaced further apart, she said.

   ``He said, `They showed us a picture of it launching in the
snow,''' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> recalled. ```They said it would be OK.'
<p>
   ``I'm so much smarter now,'' she said. ``Now I would have said,
`Are you talking about administration? Are you talking about
engineers?'''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scobee</ENAMEX> children were in their early 20s at the time of the
Challenger disaster. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kathie Scobee Fulgham</ENAMEX> is a public relations
director in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich Scobee</ENAMEX> is an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> pilot who
served in Desert Storm and whose risk-taking profession probably
rivals that of this father.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Scobee</ENAMEX> flew as a test pilot,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rogers</ENAMEX> said, mulling the
similarities between father and son. ``Some of those test flights
were more dangerous, I thought, than the space shuttle.''
<p>
    &UR; --- &LR; 
<p>
   The memorial service for the Challenger crew was held three days
after the accident. It was an outdoor ceremony with President and
Mrs. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reagan</ENAMEX> and the numbed families of the crew sitting under a
cloudy sky at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Johnson Space Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Toward the end of the service, a squadron of jets screamed
across the sky in the ``missing man formation,'' prompting the
widow of Pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Smith</ENAMEX> to look up and smile.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jane Smith Wolcott</ENAMEX> still reacts that way to the sight and sound
of airplanes. She married <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norfolk</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, physician <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dixon Wolcott</ENAMEX>, a
longtime family friend, after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Smith</ENAMEX>'s death and clearly enjoys
her new home's proximity to a naval air base.
<p>
   ``I'm so proud of those people who fly,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolcott</ENAMEX> said. ``I love
airplanes. My back yard faces in the direction of one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
bases. I never get tired of the sound of an airplane.
<p>
   ``When I see a plane, I think of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   She still misses him terribly, she admits.
<p>
   ``He was a very vital man, with a lot of energy, goals and a
great deal of humility,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolcott</ENAMEX> said. ``I would just love to be
able to talk with him.''
<p>
   And every <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 28</TIMEX> is the same, she says  &MD;  simply awful.
<p>
   ``I always remember it. I will never forget it,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolcott</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The three <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Smith</ENAMEX> children were 8, 14 and 17 when they lost their
father. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolcott</ENAMEX> said it was especially hard for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erin</ENAMEX>, the widely
photographed little trouper who brought strangers to tears when she
arrived at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> memorial service clutching a teddy bear.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erin</ENAMEX> is now 18 and starting college. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Allison</ENAMEX>, 24, is married and
teaching fourth grade in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott</ENAMEX>, 27, is married and lives

   The families of Mission Specialists <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron McNair</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellison
Onizuka</ENAMEX> still live in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lorna Onizuka</ENAMEX> is employed by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Space Development Agency</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>; her daughters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darien</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janelle</ENAMEX>, are now 20 and 26 years old.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNair</ENAMEX>'s children were the youngest of the crew's offspring at
the time of the accident. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joy</ENAMEX> is now 11. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie</ENAMEX> is 13 and obsessed
with basketball, according to his mother.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cheryl McNair</ENAMEX> confesses she is surprised by the level of concern
people still express for her family 10 years after the accident. In
her work with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Challenger Center</ENAMEX> and with a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Houston</ENAMEX> foundation,
strangers go out of their way to tell her how affected they were by
the death of the crew.
<p>
   Her children don't really remember their father, and they
mercifully don't remember being at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Canaveral</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, the day he
died. But their mother is convinced his life continues to make an
impact on them.
<p>
   ``I caught <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reggie</ENAMEX> when he was much younger counting his dad's
trophies,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNair</ENAMEX> said. ``And I said, `Well, hey, what are you
doing?' And he said, counting those trophies, because he was going
to get as many as his dad.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> did so much in the short amount of time he was here,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McNair</ENAMEX> said. ``He was just excited about everything.
<p>
   ``I always thought he would do something extraordinary with his
life, because he was that kind of person.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvis</ENAMEX>' father and stepmother live about 45 miles outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape
Canaveral</ENAMEX>, where nearly every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX> rocket is launched.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Jarvis</ENAMEX> studiously avoids each launch, not because of
the memory it conjures of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="10 years ago">that day 10 years ago</TIMEX>, but because he
thinks his presence is bad luck.
<p>
   ``I don't watch them at all,'' he said. ``I won't go over
there.''
<p>
   He watched two of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>'s early launches back in the days of the
unmanned Delta rockets, he said, and they both exploded. He hadn't
seen another launch until Challenger.
<p>
   Maybe common sense tells <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvis</ENAMEX> he is being superstitious, but
he will not risk it. ``If it continues to work well, I'll stay away
from it,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Jarvis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hughes Aircraft</ENAMEX> engineer on loan to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NASA</ENAMEX>, was so
excited about the Challenger mission that ``he was out of his
mind,'' his father remembers.
<p>
   ``I was always proud of him,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvis</ENAMEX> recalled, adding, ``He
didn't have to go up in that thing to make me proud.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jarvis</ENAMEX> lost his composure when trying to talk about his last
conversation with his son. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Jarvis</ENAMEX> took over, explaining that
``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> and his boys'' were not in the habit of sharing their
feelings about each other.
<p>
   ``In his last brief conversation ... <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg</ENAMEX> said, `I love you
dad.' And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce</ENAMEX> was able to reply, `I love you son  &MD;  I'm proud of
you.'
<p>
   ``Those were the last words that were ever said,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ellen Jarvis</ENAMEX>
said. ``As things developed, he was very glad they'd had those
words.''

CHOPPER STUNT WORKS DESPITE FEARS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">PHOENIX</ENAMEX>  &MD;  No question, it was an awesome sight: a helicopter
appearing seemingly out of nowhere above <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona State University</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sun Devil Stadium</ENAMEX> during Super Bowl XXX and landing lightly on
stage to swoop away halftime headliner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Diana Ross</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But it was also a potentially deadly stunt, opposed by fire and
safety officials, that required a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX> insurance policy.
<p>
   For weeks, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Football League</ENAMEX> officials and Super Bowl
planners debated the risk of bringing the helicopter into the
packed stadium.
<p>
   They even checked with Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fife Symington</ENAMEX>, who gave his OK.
<p>
   But no one was sure until it happened that it could be pulled
off.
<p>
   ``We didn't think it was worth it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tempe</ENAMEX> Fire Marshal
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marc Scott</ENAMEX>, one of a number of fire and safety officials who said
they repeatedly urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX> not to use the helicopter, fearing
for the safety of the fans.
<p>
   Even <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> was a little apprehensive about it and considered
using a body double, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Munhall</ENAMEX>, who headed operations for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Super Bowl Host Committee</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A public-address announcer assured the crowd several times,
``This stunt has been tested for your safety. Please remain in your
seats. You will be a part of Super Bowl history with the takeoff
and landing of an aircraft in the stadium.''
<p>
   But out of sight in the tunnel at the north end zone sat a fire
engine and a ``brush truck,'' which is used to douse flames
quickly. All the firefighters were ready, dressed in full gear in
case they were needed.
<p>
   About 45 firefighters were at the game, along with about a dozen
doctors on call.
<p>
   At a nearby command post, nurses waited in flight suits. If
anything had gone wrong, triage would have been set up in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASU</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Packard Stadium</ENAMEX> and victims taken there by ambulance.
<p>
   The helicopter pilot was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rich Lee</ENAMEX>, a highly decorated flier who
made impressive pickups and drop-offs in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>. At his side was a
second pilot in case something went wrong in midflight.
<p>
   The risk was considered such that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Host Committee</ENAMEX> took out a
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400 million</NUMEX> insurance policy for the helicopter stunt. Originally,
the committee thought <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> would have been enough.
<p>
   ``Here comes my ride!'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ross</ENAMEX> shouted as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> MD
Explorer came into sight.
<p>
   It swept over the edge of the stadium and landed on a dime on
the stage.
<p>
   ``I can tell you, I let out a big sigh of relief when it was
over,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Patterson</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Host Committee</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Steeg</ENAMEX>, who directs all Super Bowl preparations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX>,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Symington</ENAMEX> was consulted because of the state's potential
liability if a disaster had occurred at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASU</ENAMEX> stadium.
<p>
   The decision to go ahead was made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> after
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Symington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ASU</ENAMEX> officials, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Host Committee</ENAMEX> members and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neil Austrian</ENAMEX>,
president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NFL</ENAMEX>, watched eight landings by the helicopter.
<p>
   ``Each time, he landed in the same six-inch space,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill
Shover</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Host Committee</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But there were concerns about mechanical failures, whether
someone throwing something from the stands could lodge in the
rotor, and that a strong wind could toss the chopper into the
stands.
<p>
   ``We measured the potential risk against the reward, and all the
odds seemed to favor the reward,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steeg</ENAMEX> said. ``It was something
that had never been done before.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The flier whose <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> F-14A fighter plunged into a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> suburb on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, killing himself and four other people,
crashed another jet into the sea <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</TIMEX>. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> investigators
and senior admirals forgave him, saying he made a mistake in
pursuit of the combative flying that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> wants and encourages
in its pilots.
<p>
   The flier, Lt. Comdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stacy Bates</ENAMEX>, flew aggressively, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> official said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, but he added: ``We want them to fly
aggressively. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> was highly motivated and that accident was a
one-time glitch on his record. He was a great aviator.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> invests years and more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX> to train each of
its fighter pilots, and is reluctant to dismiss them if senior
officers believe an erring pilot can learn from mistakes.
<p>
   But as military investigators sifted through the wreckage on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> for clues to what caused the crash that killed the
fighter's two-man crew and three people on the ground, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
officials said they did not know what caused <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>' second crash,
or why his squadron had lost so many F-14 Tomcats.
<p>
   The crash was the fourth in 16 months for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighter Squadron 213</ENAMEX>,
a 14-plane unit known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighting Blacklions</ENAMEX> and one of six
F-14 squadrons assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miramar Naval Air Station</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Diego</ENAMEX>. The unit's safety record is by far the worst among the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s 13 F-14 squadrons.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> was blamed for losing control of his F-14 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last April</TIMEX> while
conducting training maneuvers off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last September</TIMEX>, an F-14A
from the squadron exploded in flight off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philippines</ENAMEX>, but both
crew members ejected safely. The cause of that accident is still
under investigation.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX>, one the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s first female fighter pilots, Lt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara S. Hultgreen</ENAMEX>, died in a training accident off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern
California</ENAMEX>, rekindling tensions within the military over the
decision to expand some combat roles for women. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> concluded
that that accident resulted from a combination of pilot error and
mechanical failure.
<p>
   ``You go back 10 or 15 years and they are snake bit,'' said a
retired admiral who once commanded the squadron. ``We've tried to
put top-notch pilots and maintenance people there. You can't
believe in luck or superstition, but they're behind the eight ball
and have stayed there.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> ordered the squadron to suspend its operations for
three days for safety reasons after the second of the squadron's
four crashes. Vice Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Bennitt</ENAMEX>, the commander of naval air
forces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, immediately ordered the squadron to stand
down again after the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> to review its safety record
and procedures.
<p>
   The crash underscores the fact that even in peacetime, operating
complex weapons of war is a hazardous business. Twelve F-14 fliers
have died in training accidents since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But the accident also raises questions about the F-14's safety
record. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>, the fighter has a major crash rate of 5.93 per
100,000 flight hours, compared with 4.82 major crashes per 100,000
hours for all <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> tactical aircraft. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials note that
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1981</TIMEX>, the F-14's major accident rate is slightly lower than
the overall tactical aircraft rate.
<p>
   Many naval aviators have complained that the engines on the
older A-model F-14's are not powerful enough to perform the
demanding aerial maneuvers they fly. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is replacing them
with a more powerful engine that is now on about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX> of the
fleet's F-14's. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighter Squadron 213</ENAMEX> flies all A-model F-14's.
<p>
   In the latest accident, the twin-engine, two-seat Tomcat crashed
shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berry Field</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX>
airfield adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville International Airport</ENAMEX>. The jet left
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miramar Air Station</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> on a
routine training mission.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennitt</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials approved <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>'
request to use a maximum-performance takeoff, in which a pilot
turns on the jet's after-burner and soars straight up moments after
the aircraft leaves the ground. After screaming up through the
clouds, the F-14 then came straight down, exploding into a huge
fireball. The Tomcat was carrying 16,000 pounds of fuel on takeoff.
<p>
   ``We may never know why the crew didn't eject,'' Rear Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skip
Dirren</ENAMEX> told reporters on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. Newer fighter planes do
have recorders, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dirren</ENAMEX> said, but they were not included when the
F-14A's were built in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, now the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northrop-Grumman Corp.</ENAMEX>, manufactured the F-14's, which cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$32
million</NUMEX> each.
<p>
   Killed besides <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>, 33, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chattanooga</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, was the jet's
radar operator, Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Alden Higgins</ENAMEX>, 28, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dover-Foxcroft</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX>. Three civilians were also killed when the plane hit a house.
They were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elmer Newsom</ENAMEX>, 66; his wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ada</ENAMEX>, 63, and a friend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ewing
T. Wair</ENAMEX>, 53.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The squadron commander of the F-14 pilot in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> crash that killed five people <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> has been relieved
of his command, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Citing three accidents over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> decided to
reassign the commander, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Kilian</ENAMEX>, because of ``a loss of trust
and confidence'' in his ability to lead the squadron, said a
spokesman, Comdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg Hartung</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighter Squadron 213</ENAMEX>, a 14-plane unit based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miramar Naval
Base</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>, had developed by far the worst safety record
among the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s 13 F-14 squadrons, with four crashes over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last
16 months</TIMEX>, three after <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilian</ENAMEX> became its leader.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer said that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilian</ENAMEX> had an ``excellent reputation.''
<p>
   ``But in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>,'' the officer said, speaking on the condition
of anonymity, ``we hold people accountable for things that happen
during the time of their command. In this particular case, this
particular squadron has an exceptionally high accident rate  &MD; 
higher than any other.''
<p>
   The officer said the decision to reassign <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilian</ENAMEX> to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>
headquarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fighter Wing</ENAMEX> was made <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> by the
commander of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrier Air Wing 11</ENAMEX>, Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis Gillespie</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilian</ENAMEX> could not be reached for comment.
<p>
   In the latest crash, an F-14 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squadron 213</ENAMEX> plunged to the
ground immediately after takeoff on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX>, killing the pilot, Lt.
Comdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Stacy Bates</ENAMEX>, the jet's radar operator Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Graham Alden
Higgins</ENAMEX>, and three civilians in a house the plane crashed into.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> had crashed an F-14 into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> during a routine
training flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials blamed him for causing the
accident, in which no one was hurt, by losing control, but forgave
him because they felt he was displaying the sort of aggressive
flying style the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> encourages.
<p>
    &UR; 
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
    &LR;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer said there had still been no determination of
a cause of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> crash. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX> had requested and been given
permission for ``an unrestricted climb to 15,000 feet''  &MD;  a style
of takeoff in which the pilot soars straight up moments after
leaving the ground. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer declined to comment on whether
the unrestricted climb could be linked to the crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer confirmed that the pilot's parents had been at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Berry Field</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX> airfield adjacent to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville
International Airport</ENAMEX> watching the takeoff.
<p>
   Flying fighter planes is a dangerous business, even in
peacetime: since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, 12 F-14 pilots have died in training
accidents. But over the years, many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> pilots have complained
that the engines on A-model F-14s, like all the planes in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squadron
213</ENAMEX>, are not powerful enough for the maneuvers they are asked to
perform. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials have begun to replace them with more
powerful models.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squadron 213</ENAMEX>'s string of crashes began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX>, before
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kilian</ENAMEX> took over, when one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s first female fighter
pilots, Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kara S. Hultgreen</ENAMEX>, died in a training accident off
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern California</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> crash and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bates</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> accident,
an F-14 from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Squadron 213</ENAMEX> also exploded <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last September</TIMEX> without
fatalities just after taking off from an aircraft carrier.
<p>
   After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>'s accident, the squadron was ordered to stop
flying while its safety procedures were reviewed. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hartung</ENAMEX>, said that order remained in effect.

SAFETY OF MILITARY AVIATION IMPROVING, STUDY SUGGESTS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JAMES KUHNHENN</ENAMEX>
c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Star</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The number of military aircraft accidents has
dropped dramatically in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last 20 years</TIMEX>, making the rate of
fatalities in military plane crashes comparable to that of
commercial airliners.
<p>
   Still, such accidents cost the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> a
year, suggesting that while crashes have declined, the cost per
accident has increased significantly.
<p>
   Congressional investigators, in a report released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, found
that the number of major accidents dropped from 309 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> to 76
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. Likewise, the number of deaths dropped from 285 to 85.
<p>
   ``While <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> was the safest year in military aviation history,
there is room for improvement,'' said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ike Skelton</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>,
who requested the study. ``One crash is too many; one death is too
many.''
<p>
   In an otherwise upbeat report, the study by the congressional
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Accounting Office</ENAMEX> did question the process by which the
military investigates such crashes and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skelton</ENAMEX> recommended ways to
make investigative boards more independent from commanding
officers.
<p>
   Coincidentally, the report came just days after an F-14A
``Tomcat'' fighter jet crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, killing two
crew members and three persons on the ground. The cause of that
accident is under investigation and was not included in the data
analyzed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> investigators did conclude that human error accounted
for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">73 percent</NUMEX> of the military aircraft accidents in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX>. That number is comparable with the rate of human error in
commercial flight accidents, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> investigators, the rate of fatalities per
100,000 flying hours dropped from about 4 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1975</TIMEX> to 1.7 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.
Significantly, however, the rate of fatalities in commercial
carriers has been no higher than 1.4 since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> and was 1.2 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> data.
<p>
   The study did not include crashes or fatalities involving combat
and focused on accidents that caused death or permanent injury, or
destroyed or severely damaged an aircraft.
<p>
   Over the 20-year period of the study, military aircraft were
involved in 3,828 accidents, killing 3,819 persons and destroying
3,483 of the aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skelton</ENAMEX> requested the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> study <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</TIMEX> after a succession of
five military airplanes crashes killed 18 persons within five
weeks.
<p>
   The study also came amid reports that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> commanders
falsified crash investigative files to avoid embarrassment in about
30 cases. The results of an investigation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
inspector general are under review.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GAO</ENAMEX> investigators concluded that despite past entreaties to the
armed forces to give their investigative boards greater
independence, movement toward that end has been slow.
<p>
   Until recently, only the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> required that its investigative
board include a voting member from outside the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> chain of
command. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>, after convening a commission to improve
crash investigations, decided only in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September</TIMEX> to add an
independent voice to its investigative board. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, meanwhile,
has not taken any steps to make its board more independent.
<p>
   ``This creates, at a minimum, the appearance that investigations
are not completely independent,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Skelton</ENAMEX> said. With his changes,
he said, ``no one could say someone in the chain of command is not
going to call a pilot a hot dog.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  It's the phone call no one wants to get, but everyone
knows might come one day.
<p>
   It came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Tuesday</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> got word that a chartered 757
aircraft crashed shortly after takeoff from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX>.
All 189 passengers are feared dead.
<p>
   The crash, only the second in the history of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757,
came <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">less than two months after an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> 757 slammed
into a mountain as it approached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>.</TIMEX> Four people
survived the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 20</TIMEX> crash that killed 160 people. The cause has
not yet been determined.
<p>
   After hearing the news of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alas Nacionales</ENAMEX> Flight 301 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, members of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Safety Investigation Group</ENAMEX> monitored
the situation <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">throughout the night</TIMEX> and quickly assembled a team of
safety experts to be on standby in case they were needed at the
crash scene.
<p>
   One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> air safety investigator was expected to arrive
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Plata</ENAMEX> to assist a team from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> in trying to
determine why the two-engine jet crashed. More <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> engineers
will be called in if needed.
<p>
   When an accident occurs, government investigative agencies  &MD; 
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers  &MD;  are responsible for
determining what went wrong. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> usually invites the
aircraft's manufacturer, in this case <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, to help search for
clues and to provide techical support if needed.
<p>
   A typical <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> team, whose members are assigned to aircraft
crashes on a rotating basis, usually includes an accident
investigator, a pilot and a structures expert.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> investigators typically help gather evidence, conduct
engineering analysis and, if needed, reconstruct major portions of
the airplane from the wreckage.
<p>
   Until the supervising agency has completed its accident
investigation and issued its final report, the company is
prohibited from commenting on the investigation findings.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Young</ENAMEX> said the aircraft involved in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>'s crash was delivered to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1985</TIMEX>
and was powered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rolls-Royce Plc</ENAMEX> RB-211 engines.
<p>
   The jetliner was the 31st off the assembly line, out of a total
694 produced to date, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1995</TIMEX>, the plane
had 29,000 flight hours and 13,400 takeoff/landing cycles.
<p>
   Plans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757's development began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>. It was
first flown <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 28, 1982</TIMEX>, and it entered commercial service with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastern Airlines</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1, 1983</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The 757 is a twin-engine, medium- to long-range jetliner that
can carry up to 239 passengers, depending on cabin configuration.
<p>
   According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>, the worldwide fleet of 757s has carried
more than 565 million passengers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">since entering commercial service</TIMEX>.

   (Ed. Note: On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 12, 1996</TIMEX>, 11 people were killed in a
300-car crash on a foggy highway between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Milan</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Trieste</ENAMEX>. This
rush-hour disaster was one of the deadliest episodes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Italy</ENAMEX>'s
history of fog-related accidents.)
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   Author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Sandburg</ENAMEX> described it as coming in ``on little cat's
feet.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Dickens</ENAMEX>, taking an understandably dim view of a
legendary <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> ``pea-souper,'' or fog laced with industrial soot,
proclaimed that the skies had ``gone into mourning for the death of
the sun.''
<p>
   Taking a cheerier view, children's-book author <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Susi Gregg Fowler</ENAMEX>
has likened fog to a ``cloud of silver cotton candy.''
<p>
   Indeed, fog is just a ``cloud intersecting the ground,'' in the
words of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Arizona State</ENAMEX> climatologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Brazel</ENAMEX>, produced by
warm, moist air touching a cool surface  &MD;  land or water.
<p>
   The air is cooled to ``dew point'' and the moisture is condensed
into liquid droplets. These droplets coalesce around microscopic
nuclei.
<p>
   So minuscule are fog droplets that it takes billions to fill a
teaspoon. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> bulletin noted that ``a block of fog
three feet wide, six feet high and 100 feet long equals less than
one-seventh of a cup of water.''
<p>
   On the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, the arid mountain village of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chungungo</ENAMEX>
was forever short of water, which had to be trucked in over 13
miles of dirt roads. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX> the 300-plus villagers have plenty of
water, thanks to fog.
<p>
   On the slopes of a mountain rising above <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chungungo</ENAMEX>, Chilean and
Canadian scientists erected 75 nets held in place by eucalyptus
poles. About one-third of the fog's tiny water particles hit the
net's fibers and coalesce into water droplets.
<p>
   Then the droplets trickle into troughs and the water  &MD; 
remarkably pure  &MD;  flows to a 25,000-gallon tank.
<p>
   There is little rainfall on the volcanic peaks rising out of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chalbi Desert</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kenya</ENAMEX>, yet lush jungles exist on the mountain
slopes. Fog covers the mountains for several hours a day, watering
the green growth.
<p>
   We can sometimes use fog, but we can't control it.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 26, 1956</TIMEX>, the Italian luxury liner Andrea Doria emerged
suddenly from a fog bank off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> coast, crashed into
the Swedish liner Stockholm and sank, killing 52 people.
<p>
   The worst <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> fog of all  &MD;  a lethal mix of fog and industrial
pollutants  &MD;  descended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1952</TIMEX>. As a consequence, an
estimated 4,000 people died of bronchitis or pneumonia.
<p>
   A similar tragedy happened in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Donora</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Penn.</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1948</TIMEX>, when fog
mixed with smog from railroad engines, manufacturing plants and
steamboats on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Monongahela River</ENAMEX>. Nearly one of every two
citizens of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Donora</ENAMEX> became ill, and 20 died.
<p>
   Fog makes highway driving hazardous. One chain-reaction
collision on a foggy German autobahn made scrap metal out of 118
cars. Pileups of as many as 200 cars have occurred in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, the worst winter for fog-induced
chain-reaction tragedies was in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990-1991</TIMEX>. Four pileups in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Utah</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> involved 238 vehicles, resulting in
21 deaths and more than 90 injuries.
<p>
   When airports are blanketed with heavy fog, airline companies  &MD; 
and inevitably passengers  &MD;  pay a heavy price for delays. This
occurs in spite of radar, autopilot and all the rest of the complex
modern navigation and communication devices in use.
<p>
   ``Obviously, if you can't see the runway, it's very difficult to
land,'' says meteorologist <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim McClung</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> office of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Weather Service</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oxnard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``The biggest challenge for pilots and air-traffic
controllers,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McClung</ENAMEX> says, ``is looking at the current weather
and deciding whether an aircraft can make it in safely or not.
<p>
   ``One of the problems with fog is that it comes and goes. You
can have a plane coming and it looks pretty good 10 miles out, and
by the time the plane is ready to land, the fog has come in
again.''
<p>
   What can be done about fog that pollutes and makes travel
dangerous?
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> has long since cleaned up its act, banning the burning of
soft coal and greatly reducing smokestack emissions. The city still
has fog, but it's not deadly. Even songbirds missing from the city
for nearly a century have returned.
<p>
   During World War II, the British developed Fog Investigation and
Dispersal Operation, which required the burning of gasoline along
runways to dispel the fog and facilitate landings. But it was
expensive and hair-raising for pilots to land between the flames.
<p>
   At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orly</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">DeGaulle</ENAMEX> airports near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, the French have
installed a system called Turboclair  &MD;  jet engines channeling
exhaust heat across the approach end of a runway.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles International Airport</ENAMEX>, however, has dismissed the
idea as too costly and not sufficiently effective.
<p>
   Most airports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> eliminate fog by ``seeding'' it. Airplanes
are sent up to disperse it, using substances such as silver iodide
or solidified carbon dioxide (dry ice).
<p>
   The fog droplets coalesce around these substances and fall to
the ground, looking a little like snow. The fog lifts, at least
long enough for a plane or two to land.
<p>
   What to do about fog-shrouded seacoasts? Radar, foghorns and
lighthouses.
<p>
   Fog-shrouded highways? The experts haven't been able to do much
more than post warnings and give motorists advice  &MD;  use your
low-beam lights or fog lights and get off the road if you can.
<p>
   So at the same time humans benefit from fog in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX>,
we continue to fight it at airports, on seacoasts and on highways.
Will we ever win the battle?
<p>
   We haven't the foggiest.

SIDEBAR: TYPES OF FOG
    Radiation fog usually occurs at night or just before dawn,
when the air is moist and still.
   An absence of cloud cover allows heat to escape from the earth's
surface. When the saturated air touches the chilled land, radiation
fog forms. It usually disperses by sunrise.
   Radiation fog develops on clear, calm nights, mostly in areas
where there is much moisture, such as river valleys, lakes and
harbors.
    Upslope fog is sometimes called ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX>'' fog because it
typically forms on the eastern slopes of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rocky Mountains</ENAMEX>.
   Warm tropical air from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Mexico</ENAMEX> spreads up the
mountains and cools. Dew point is reached, fog forms and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX> 
and a lot of other towns  get misty.
    ``Sea smoke'' or ``vapor,'' as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> fishermen call it, is the
opposite of upslope fog and occurs when cold air passes from the
land over relatively warm coastal waters.
   In northern climates, sea smoke sometimes leaves a coating of
frost on people, tree branches and other objects near the water.
    Advection fog occurs when moisture-laden air comes in from the
ocean and hits the colder surface waters off the coast.
   Advection fog rolls into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX> almost every day,
shrouding the Golden Gate Bridge, delighting tourists and prompting
police and cable-car drivers to put on their yellow slickers.
   The same fog probably caused Sir <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis Drake</ENAMEX> to miss <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco Bay</ENAMEX> when he came down the coast in his square-rigger
Golden Hind <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">400 years ago</TIMEX>.
    Smog is fog made heavier and darker as a result of large
amounts of air pollutants.
   This photochemical haze that plagues many large urban centers is
caused by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation on an
atmosphere polluted with hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides from
automobile exhaust.

<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carolyn and Dennis Sims</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, their honeymoon in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tahiti</ENAMEX> was a dream that became a nightmare. As their plane landed,
dirt and rocks pelted the windows. Flight attendants screamed in
French. Luggage careened from overhead bins and water spilled over
the wing. Alas, the 747 had overshot the runway and landed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simses</ENAMEX> emerged relatively unscathed, but later in
their honeymoon had to deal with food poisoning, a flat tire and a
broken doorknob.
<p>
   But there is a happy ending: The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Simses</ENAMEX> are grand prize winners
in the second annual Honeymoon Disasters contest sponsored by

They were forced to jump off a pier and into the ocean, with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clint</ENAMEX>
suffering a cut arm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen</ENAMEX> created a makeshift tourniquet from her

<p>
    &MD; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julie Esposito</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ruskin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, discovered in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Aruba</ENAMEX> that her

<p>
   Though officials here, from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> on down, like to describe
American policy as ``37 years of unrelenting hostility toward the
Cuban revolution,'' that overstates the case. President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy
Carter</ENAMEX>, for instance, made consistent efforts from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX> on to
reduce tensions between the two countries and to restore some
semblance of diplomatic ties.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> rewarded him in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1980</TIMEX> with the Mariel crisis and
125,000 Cuban refugees, which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX>'s supporters believed were
factors in his defeat at the polls <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">that November</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Throughout his long stay in power, in fact, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has taken
actions that transformed his domestic woes into confrontations with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. Faced with discontent about economic and
political conditions that exploded into a street protest in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>,
he manufactured the crisis that eventually forced the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>
to end its 30-year policy of automatically treating all Cubans
leaving the island as political refugees.
<p>
   Cuban officials obviously knew that an attack on American-based
civilian aircraft would bring about yet another crisis with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eugene Carroll</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Center
for Defense Information</ENAMEX> recalls a meeting with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cuban Armed
Forces</ENAMEX> high command <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX> in which he was asked what
would happen if Cuban MIG's shot down one of the exiles' aircraft.
<p>
   ``My answer was that it would be a political disaster, the
people in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> who claim we are not being tough enough
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> would seize on it as evidence we have to get tougher,''
recalled <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX>, who was leading a delegation of retired American
diplomats and soldiers.
<p>
   But the Cuban officers reacted as if they were under siege by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX> said, arguing that ``moving the
headquarters of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southern Command</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Panama</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> indicates
a greater focus on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>,'' and increased the likelihood ``we will
foment internal disorder, and use that as an excuse to invade.''
<p>
   Overall, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carroll</ENAMEX> said, the Cuban high command seemed to him to
be ``paranoid and highly suspicious.''

<p>
   Sixteen people have been killed and 18 aircraft have been
destroyed in an extraordinary rash of accidents involving the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> naval air force since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX>, leaving <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>
investigators baffled.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first eight weeks of this year</TIMEX> alone, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX>'s
air arm has experienced seven crashes in which 12 people and eight
aircraft have been lost, including <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX>'s loss of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey Island</ENAMEX>-based EA-6B Prowler in the waters off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southern
California</ENAMEX>, where two of its four crewmen perished.
<p>
   ``There is no common thread (to the accidents) and that is
frustrating everyone,'' said one senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officer, who asked to
remain anonymous. Other officials who have reviewed preliminary
evidence agree that even in accidents involving the same aircraft
models there is no obvious connection.
<p>
   After <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s EA-6B crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>, in an unprecedented
safety move, grounded an entire carrier air wing indefinitely to
review flight safety procedures.
<p>
   The Prowler crash from the USS Kitty Hawk marked the fourth jet
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carrier Air Wing 11</ENAMEX>, the wing now grounded, to be lost since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX>, and its seventh to crash in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>, officials
said.
<p>
   Investigators are looking at everything from maintenance
problems to adequacy of spare parts and effectiveness of pilot
safety training, but report no common clues to the mishaps so far.
<p>
   Meanwhile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials have imposed a number of safety
``stand down'' periods for fliers to review flying safety rules and
survival skills, while investigators have pored over accident data
to determine why the aircraft went down.
<p>
   Among the problems the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> is dealing with:
<p>
    &MD; The eight aircraft lost <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> constitute nearly <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>
of the 21 aircraft losses suffered by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> command in
an entire two-year period. Eight military fliers and three
civilians were killed.
<p>
   By contrast, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Atlantic Fleet</ENAMEX>'s naval air force lost only four
aircraft in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="1995">all of 1995</TIMEX> and has recorded no aircraft accidents so
far <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>, said spokesman Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Wensing</ENAMEX>.
<p>
    &MD; In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 16 months</TIMEX>, eight <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>-based F-14 Tomcat fighters
have crashed, including three in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January this year</TIMEX>. During the same
interval, only two F-14s based in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> region were lost.
<p>
   The accidents, particularly a fiery crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> that
killed the two aircrewmen and three civilians, prompted officials
to relieve the squadron commander involved, to ground the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s
entire F-14 fleet for a 72-hour safety review, and has prompted a
congressional inquiry that will hold hearings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-April</TIMEX>.
<p>
   After the crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX>, the vice admiral commanding
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> naval air forces took the unprecedented step of ordering
the entire air wing off the carrier. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VAQ 135</ENAMEX>'s remaining three
aircraft and 240 enlisted personnel returned to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey Island
Naval Air Station</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, said base spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard
Thomas</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Wing 11</ENAMEX> remains grounded indefinitely, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas</ENAMEX> said.
Additionally, all naval aviation units in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> have been
ordered to conduct a safety 48-hour ``stand down'' between now and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 5</TIMEX> in which the fliers will undergo a concentrated review of
safety procedures.
<p>
   The recent crashes are all under investigation and cannot be
discussed in detail, said Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Hartung</ENAMEX>, spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific
Fleet</ENAMEX> naval air forces.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> launches two separate investigations when an aircraft
crashes. A legal inquest conducted by aviators looks into the
incident to determine not only the cause of the crash, but to
recommend disciplinary measures if a person is responsible for the
accident. A separate safety review is conducted to obtain
information used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy Safety Center</ENAMEX> to formulate operating
and safety policies.
<p>
   Vice Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brent Bennitt</ENAMEX>, who has seen seven of his command's
aircraft go down since he assumed command of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> naval
air forces only <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four weeks ago</TIMEX>, said in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> there seemed to
be no common denominator to the crashes, such as poor maintenance
or equipment failures. The aircrews are receiving adequate numbers
of monthly flight hours, he added.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennitt</ENAMEX> said he is concerned that in three of the recent
crashes, including the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey</ENAMEX>-based Prowler loss, it appeared that
the aircrew attempted to eject too late to survive.
<p>
   ``There is a point beyond which an aircrew knows that either the
airplane is out of control and they have exceeded the limits beyond
which they should not stay with the airplane,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennitt</ENAMEX> said,
referring to extensive safety and survival training each <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> flier
undergoes.
<p>
   All <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> aviators are being given refresher training in ejection
and survival skills, officials said.
<p>
   For the F-14 fighters, several flight operating restrictions
have been imposed to prevent engine stalls, a common problem with
the aircraft's underpowered engines, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bennitt</ENAMEX> noted.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House National Security Committee</ENAMEX> plans
hearings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX> that will focus on funding adequacy of aircraft
maintenance and spare parts.
<p>
   Meanwhile, naval aviators are gritting their teeth as they wait
for the green light to resume training.
<p>
   ``No one wanted to come into port,'' the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> official
said of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Wing 11</ENAMEX> following the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey</ENAMEX> Prowler crash. ``They are
ready to go back out and do it again.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> AWACS surveillance plane circled high over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Straits of Florida</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">navy</ENAMEX> cruisers, a frigate and 11 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">coast guard</ENAMEX> cutters cut
through the heavy swells.
<p>
   Over the horizon in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Key West</ENAMEX>, a squadron of F-16 fighters waited
on standby.
<p>
   Nine planes and a helicopter circled the spot in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Caribbean</ENAMEX>
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX> where Cuban MiGs shot down two Cessnas flown by
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> activists <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a week earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Almost lost amid the escort was the main body of the flotilla
itself  &MD;  two dozen fishing boats carrying friends and supporters of
the dead pilots to a memorial service.
<p>
   What was the armada protecting?
<p>
   Ostensibly, the right of Cuban-Americans to tug at <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel
Castro</ENAMEX>'s beard  &MD;  so long as they don't break <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> law by doing it
in his territory.
<p>
   But the other mission was to prevent another hijacking of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
foreign policy by the tiny band of exiles, or by anyone else.
<p>
   ``There is no government or regime that can stop what we're
going to do,'' one of the mourners said ominously <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>.
<p>
   And that was not a boast to be taken lightly. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX> the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> administration's carefully calibrated <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> policy was in
shreds, the victim of the new protest strategy by a group called
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers to the Rescue</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and election-year politics.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had been pursuing a delicate policy of
encouraging democratic change inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, while maintaining the
embargo. But the shoot-down forced him to scale back the small
steps toward rapprochement and re-escalate the war of words.
<p>
   He called the attack ``an appalling reminder of the nature of
the Cuban regime  &MD;  repressive, violent, scornful of international
law.''
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, Ambassador <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Madeleine Albright</ENAMEX> released
the text of intercepted radio chatter between the Cuban MiG pilots
and their base on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 24</TIMEX>, intended for pure shock value.
<p>
   ``We took out their cojones (balls),'' a pilot exclaimed after
his missile hit the first Cessna. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> declared, ``This isn't
cojones, this is cowardice.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX>'s Foreign Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roberto Robaina</ENAMEX> retorted: ``We've
always had plenty of the first and have never suffered from the
latter.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s comments were ``nasty for a lady,'' he said.
``Chauvinistic,'' countered <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> also executed a sharp right turn on Capitol Hill,
agreeing to support the so-called Cuban Liberty Bill sponsored by
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jesse Helms</ENAMEX> and Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Burton</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The most provocative section authorizes Americans to sue foreign
firms that do business in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> over property confiscated by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> government. It also would deny <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> visas to anyone dealing
in confiscated property.
<p>
   Until the shoot-down, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s foreign-policy team had argued
that the bill was a radical departure from the norms of
international trade, and that by giving the economic embargo the
force of law, it would prevent any president from engaging <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> gave in after winning a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> compromise that permits him
to delay implementation for up to six months if he deems it
necessary for the national interest.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>'s closest allies oppose Helms-Burton. But in recent
years, domestic politics have driven <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy toward <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX> more
than foreign-policy concerns. In voting terms, the anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>
lobby is not formidable.
<p>
   Cuban-Americans account for just <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">7 percent</NUMEX> of the electorate in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, and even smaller numbers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, another swing
state. But their symbolic clout is considerable, particularly with
Republican challengers championing their cause.
<p>
   ``After months of moving the wrong way  &MD;  toward coddling <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>
 &MD;  President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> has yet to understand that the only way to deal
with tyranny is with real firmness and pressure,''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> presidential hopeful <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> declared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
can't hope to outbash the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> hard-liners on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, but there is no
immediate political downside to playing it tough.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> knows all about the perils and rewards of beating the
anti-<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> drum. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980</TIMEX>, backlash over riots by Cuban Marielitos
interned at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Chaffee</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ark.</ENAMEX>, under President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jimmy Carter</ENAMEX> may
have cost <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> re-election as governor.
<p>
   During his presidential run, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> raked in <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$275,000</NUMEX> in
donations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">south Florida</ENAMEX> when he backed a tough new sanctions
bill and accused the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bush</ENAMEX> administration of missing ``a big
opportunity to put the hammer down on <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fidel Castro</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   But once in office, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> found himself in the same cramped
corner as eight previous presidents. Latin and world leaders
pressured him to agree to a regional approach. Business leaders
wanted the freedom to invest in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> allowed them to
do in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, when a new wave of refugees threatened to overwhelm the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> base at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guantanamo Bay</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> took away refugees' automatic
right to enter the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, in return for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX>'s promise to
end the exodus.
<p>
   Even though he offered some small carrots  &MD;  phone links, charter
flights, easier passage for academics and artists  &MD;  his response
infuriated many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> Cubans.
<p>
   Ironically, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s actions may have sealed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>'
determination to press a confrontation. They had won fame and
donations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> by rescuing thousands of rafters from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Straits</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When the rafters could no longer gain <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> asylum, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>
found a new way to torment <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> and ensure their place as the
exile organization with the most moxie.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last July</TIMEX>, when they first braved <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX> airspace to drop small
leaflets from a blue and white <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Cessna</ENAMEX>, one witness recalls, ``The
usual response was `what cojones these <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX> have.'''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> group's leader, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bay of Pigs</ENAMEX> veteran <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jose Basulto</ENAMEX>,
donated <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">several thousand dollars</NUMEX> to the leader of a new
pro-democracy coalition in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Concilio Cubano</ENAMEX>. And he allegedly
made other illegal overflights  &MD;  two, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>; as
many as 20, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Cubans complained loudly about the violations of their
airspace. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials repeatedly warned the exiles to desist,
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> was investigating whether
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX> had filed false flight plans.
<p>
   Privately, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> officials were seething about the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s lethargy in revoking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Basulto</ENAMEX>'s license. But the aviation
officials wanted proof.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newsweek</ENAMEX> has learned that on the day of the ill-fated flight,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> asked the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Customs Service</ENAMEX> to use its high-tech
tracking gear at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">March Air Force Base</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> to monitor all
aircraft movements around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> was waiting, too. Just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks earlier</TIMEX>, a delegation of
retired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials returned from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX> warning that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>
seemed prepared to blow the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>' Cessnas out of the sky. The
day before the fatal flight, one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Juan Pablo
Roque</ENAMEX>, redefected to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   He later charged that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX> were preparing a sabotage
campaign in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>, with plans to kill <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> himself. That may have
been propaganda, but <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX> was primed for a showdown.
<p>
   Clipped wings? Did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> get what he wanted? Many <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>
specialists think so. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX> had been demanding that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
authorities clip the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>' wings, and even the Helms-Burton Act
will give the Cuban strongman an excuse to fan anti-American
sentiment at home.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> has figured out that Helms-Burton creates more problems
for us than for him,'' says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wayne Smith</ENAMEX>, former chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
interests section in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Havana</ENAMEX>. It is a classic <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> move.
<p>
   ``Whenever there's an internal problem, he always looks for a
conflict to show that the real problem is the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>,'' says
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Sanchez Lopez</ENAMEX>, a top dissident in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cuba</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Whether relations deteriorate further may be up to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brothers</ENAMEX>.
A new federal order formally barring the group from Cuban airspace
is no guarantee that they won't try to goad <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> further.
<p>
   And if the showdown escalates, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Castro</ENAMEX> can always send forth new
rafters  &MD;  the same present he gave <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carter</ENAMEX> in an election year.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guantanamo</ENAMEX> was a disaster for us,'' groans one <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> official.
``We can't let that happen again.'' But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> has just
bargained away most of its flexibility.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brussels</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> won the backing of its
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Union</ENAMEX> partners to clamp down on airline companies with
poor security records to avoid accidents like <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s crash
off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dominican Republic</ENAMEX> which killed 189 people.
<p>
   Transport ministers told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Commission</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>
executive agency, to form a group of airline experts that could
~make recommendations by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June</TIMEX> on how to identify and ground unsafe
carriers.
<p>
   The German initiative follows <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>'s crash of a Turkish
registered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757 operated by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Birgenair</ENAMEX>. Most of the passengers
were German.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matthias Wissmann</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s transport minister, said the
agreement to weed out countries where air safety standards were
``notoriously'' violated marked an ``important strategic success.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>'s accident could act as a catalyst for air transport
safety, in the same way that the death of 900 people in a shipping
accident off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Estonia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> prompted tougher
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>-wide sea transport rules, the German minister said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> aim will be to establish a system of checks similar to
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. International Safety Assessment Program</ENAMEX>, which blacklists
airline companies whose standards are judged lower than those in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   The commission said it will examine ways to ground unsafe
aircraft and vet licensing procedures for non-<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> airlines operating
in the 15-nation group.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT" MIN="Transport">French Transport</ENAMEX> Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anne-Marie Idrac</ENAMEX> said opening the
aviation market to global competition had to be accompanied by
worldwide air transport safety rules.
<p>
   The pressure to open the European airline industry to greater
competition was underscored by a dispute at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>'s meeting between
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> and member states on how to increase competition on
transatlantic air transport routes.
<p>
   The commission said it will take legal action against seven
member states, including <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, for ``illegally'' signing
open-skies agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> The commission wants the
bilateral agreements replaced with an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>-wide accord, although it
failed to win the backing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> transport ministers to go to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to start talks.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Belgium</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Luxembourg</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austria</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Denmark</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Finland</ENAMEX>, which have agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> removing
restrictions on transatlantic air routes, denied they broke any <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>
rules when they made the agreements.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, the last country to sign an agreement with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>,
did so to ensure that its national airline <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lufthansa</ENAMEX> could link
with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> in an agreement on sharing a common capacity,
reservations and pricing policy with the second-biggest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
airline. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX> said they supported
the idea of replacing their bilateral agreements with the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> with
a broader <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> accord, if such an agreement could be reached.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.K.</ENAMEX> said it opposed a common <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX> approach altogether.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commission</ENAMEX> said an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">EU</ENAMEX>-wide open-skies agreement with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> would allow for common rules on state aid, mergers, investment
and safety standards.

<p>
   The major challenge for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> when two carrier battle
groups join up near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> will be to provide a highly visible show
of force without getting in the way or inadvertently provoking a
conflict, according to two retired senior admirals with experience
in the region.
<p>
   Tensions along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> are at their highest in nearly
four decades as <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> continues a massive air and sea exercise and
ballistic missile tests directly opposite <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>, aimed at
intimidating the island's leaders in advance of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s first-ever
presidential election on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 23</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Chinese leaders, who view <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> as a renegade province, want
Taiwanese President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee Teng-hui</ENAMEX> to stop efforts to raise his
country's international profile  &MD;  efforts that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> sees as a
prelude to a bid for formal independence.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> has stepped up warnings that it would use military force
to quash Taiwanese independence and force reunification with the
mainland.
<p>
   In a show-the-flag mission to confirm <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> support for a
peaceful resolution of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> tensions, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has
dispatched the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USS Nimitz carrier battle group</ENAMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian
Gulf</ENAMEX> to join the USS Independence and its escorts operating near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We are going to signal by the move of these ships our
interest, and hopefully that will communicate, in a way that words
cannot, exactly how strong our interests are,'' said Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike
Doubleday</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<p>
   But when the Nimitz and its escorts arrive off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> about
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 20</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> force will have to balance two conflicting
requirements while operating close to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX>, the
retired admirals said in separate interviews.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> force must establish an unequivocal presence visible to
both sides along the strait, but the force cannot operate in such a
way as to provoke a clash or accidental encounter with military
units on either side, according to the retired admirals, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James
Lyons</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stan Arthur</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> commanded the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1985 to 1987</TIMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> led the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. 7th Fleet</ENAMEX> in the western <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1990 to
1992</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``You don't want to put yourself in a situation which could
ultimately result in an inadvertent confrontation,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>,
who directed a number of aircraft carrier missions close to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Soviet Union</ENAMEX> during his tenure as fleet commander.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Pacific Command</ENAMEX> are tight-lipped about
their contingency plans for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> situation, including
measures being contemplated to avoid accidental encounters between
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> units and either <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But the two retired admirals warn that on-scene commanders must
carve out areas in which <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces will maneuver, with
restrictions to avoid territorial intrusions. And they must come up
with communications and identification procedures to minimize the
risk of unplanned encounters with Chinese or Taiwanese military
forces.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> said officials from the converging three
military forces need to open unofficial communications with one
another to establish an ``airspace management'' plan and other
understandings to minimize the chance of armed encounters.
<p>
   ``We will be very mindful of restricted airspace and territorial
waters'' during any show-the-flag maneuver, predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX>, who
commanded all naval forces during the Gulf War. ``We will be very
cautious in briefing our aircrews in not having a stray event, not
unintentionally violating any airspace.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> said the obvious way to prevent inadvertent clashes is for
the different nations, particularly <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX>, to
carve out exclusive operating areas. ``The way you handle it is in
the geographic sense, (with) certain areas of responsibility,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``Their ability to identify us and our ability to identify them
exists,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> said of the Taiwanese military units. ``But in a
high-stress, fast-paced operation, there would be concerns how well
interoperability would work.''
<p>
   Both admirals said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces  &MD;  particularly carrier-based
aircraft  &MD;  will probably stay clear of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan Strait</ENAMEX> itself
while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> continues its live-fire military exercises.
<p>
   ``I don't think that it would be necessary nor wanted'' for
carrier jets to fly inside the strait, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX> said. ``The Taiwanese
have the full capability to do that themselves.''
<p>
   Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> did dispatch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nimitz battle group</ENAMEX> to
pass through the strait while on its way to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> forces already near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> seem to be operating
in accordance with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lyons</ENAMEX>' assessment. The cruiser USS Bunker Hill
has been operating south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> monitoring the missile tests,
while the Independence, three destroyers and two submarines have
shifted from a point north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> to about 110 miles east of the
island, military officials said.
<p>
   The potential hazards of an accident or unanticipated clash in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> crisis have been underscored by the escalating rhetoric
between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>. Mainland officials have said
they will not rule out military force if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX> takes further steps
toward independence, while <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX> officials say the island will
retaliate if <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> violates its territory or waters within a
12-mile-limit.
<p>
   Complicating the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> presence as the armada grows from
seven to 14 ships, including at least three nuclear submarines, is
the fact that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">7th Fleet</ENAMEX> has not trained or operated with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>
military units for more than 15 years. Connections between the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
fleet and mainland <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> naval forces are even more tenuous, since
the two navies have only met in a small number of port visits,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur</ENAMEX> said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 25</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coltec Industries Inc.</ENAMEX> said
loss of sales to the Dutch jet-maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker NV</ENAMEX>, which filed for
bankruptcy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX>, will reduce its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> net income by
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2.6 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">4 cents</NUMEX> per share.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coltec</ENAMEX> said in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX> it expected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> earnings
to be the same as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70.9 million</NUMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> because of
stagnant demand for its car parts and airplane landing gear
business.
<p>
   ``I think the earnings acceleration will be a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1998</TIMEX> event, when
the company starts taking more business in from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jackson Blackstock</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The company also said it will take a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX>-charge of
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$9.2 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">13 cents</NUMEX> a share, to cover the write-off of
development costs, losses on foreign exchange contracts, supplier
claims and other expenses related to the provision of landing gear
and flight control systems for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX> 70 and 100 aircraft.
<p>
   ``This is not a surprise,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Bunyaner</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX> was
a major customer, so this is just a reaction to what has
happened.''
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 15</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Fokker</ENAMEX>'s main units filed for bankruptcy after
failing to win bids for all or part of the company from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Samsung
Aerospace Industries Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> or <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Industries</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coltec</ENAMEX>'s shares fell 1/8 to 12 1/2 in trading of 133,900 shares
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Stock Exchange</ENAMEX>. Although the company's shares have
rebounded somewhat since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>, when they were trading at 11
after the company's profit warning, analysts do not expect the
stock to pick up strongly in the short term.
<p>
   ``The biggest reason the stock has been a disaster is because
the company has done so well for so long, its current problems seem
bigger against that background'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blackstock</ENAMEX>. ``Now that the
stock has been crushed, do you buy? Yes, but not yet.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Federal safety regulators <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> dismantled a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lycoming</ENAMEX>
aircraft engine hoping to find whether mechanical failure caused
the single-engine plane it powered to crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> as its pilot
tried to land on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Interstate 495</ENAMEX>. Four people were killed.
<p>
   But the firm that performed maintenance on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Piper</ENAMEX> Arrow
considered the engine in good operating condition the day of the
crash.
<p>
   ``We flew it <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, and everything was just fine,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Shotz</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADS Flight Services</ENAMEX>, located at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norwood Airport</ENAMEX>. ``We flew it a few hours the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">day before</TIMEX> and there
was nothing out of the ordinary.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">State Police</ENAMEX> said witnesses told them the propeller was not
turning as the plane descended quickly toward the highway in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wareham</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Exit 2</ENAMEX>. It hit a tree, swerved across the median, and
struck a station wagon in the southbound lane. The impact caused an
explosion.
<p>
   Two brothers in the plane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snyder</ENAMEX>, 49, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newton</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Snyder</ENAMEX>, 50, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hingham</ENAMEX>, were killed. Two passengers in the
station wagon, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany Wilkinson-Karp</ENAMEX>, 4, and her mother, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Karen
Wilkinson</ENAMEX>, 23, also died.
<p>
   Investigators believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Snyder</ENAMEX> picked up the plane at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ADS
Flight Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Norwood</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Plymouth Airport</ENAMEX> and
picked up <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Samuel Snyder</ENAMEX>. Then, the brothers flew to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Block Island</ENAMEX>
and were on their way home &UR;  &LR; about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12:45 p.m.</TIMEX> when they reported
engine trouble to the air traffic control center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Warwick</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">R.I.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shotz</ENAMEX> said he knew the brothers and ``they were good pilots.''
<p>
   ``They did the best they could. They tried to land on
pavement,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shotz</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilkinson</ENAMEX> and her boyfriend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lobello</ENAMEX>, 31, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wayland</ENAMEX>,
were taking <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brittany</ENAMEX> to see her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Edwin Karp</ENAMEX>, 28, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mashpee</ENAMEX>,
who had planned a 4th birthday party for the girl. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lobello</ENAMEX> was
released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Brigham and Women's Hospital</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> supervisor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jody Reeves</ENAMEX>,
said the accident-investigation team has ``been doing some engine
take-down work to see if it can run as we try to determine the
probable cause of the accident.''
<p>
   A preliminary estimate of the cause of the crash will be
released within the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">next few days</TIMEX> but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> must conduct an
extensive probe, which typically takes about six months.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A mission of hope and renewal for the tortured
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> exploded into an American tragedy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> when the plane
carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald H. Brown</ENAMEX> crashed in stormy
weather near the Croatian coast.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plane carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and 32 other passengers and
crew crashed into a cloud-shrouded mountain two miles shy of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> is presumed
dead.
<p>
   Spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glyn Davies</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
officials had contacted the families of all passengers on the
planes, but he did not release the names of those on board.
<p>
   ``We've decided that we want to give the families <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">one night</TIMEX> to
deal with this,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davies</ENAMEX> told reporters.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane, the military equivalent of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 jetliner,
left the town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX>, site of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military headquarters in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. It was following a radio beacon toward a
runway pelted by wind-driven rain when it crashed a half-hour after
takeoff.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military search and rescue teams struggled into the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">night</TIMEX>
to reach the crash site, amid unconfirmed reports that Croatian
officials had found at least four bodies and one survivor.
<p>
   ``We have no confirmed reports of either fatalities or
survivors,'' Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell Estes</ENAMEX> stressed during a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>
briefing. ``We can only hope that the reports of survivors are true
and that more are found.''
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and First Lady <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> visited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alma</ENAMEX>, before the president spoke to about 700
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> employees, many of whom were in tears.
<p>
   ``We do not know for sure what happened,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said,
apparently not wanting to rule out a possible miracle on the craggy
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> coastline. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> used the past tense and spoke in solemn
tones, however, about <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and his staff, praising them for taking
a chance to ``help the peace take hold in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   ``I am very grateful for their lives and their service,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said. ``I hope all Americans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> will be grateful for
what all the people who were on that plane did...out of a sense of
what they could do to help <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> bring peace.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, 54, was in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> leading a delegation of about a
dozen American corporate executives investigating potential
business opportunities in the war-torn region. The plane he was on
also carried 26 other passengers and 6 crew members, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Wednesday</TIMEX>, there were more questions than answers about
what caused the crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> ruled out hostile fire as a possible cause  &MD; 
there's been no fighting in the area in months  &MD;  and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said
investigators would leave <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> en route to
the accident site.
<p>
   ``There is no evidence of any hostile fire in the area, there is
no evidence of any kind of an explosion of any type on the
aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Asked why the aircraft was approaching the airport over a
half-mile-high mountain instead of along a path running alongside
the coast, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said, ``I haven't a clue why they ended up here.''
<p>
   Weather, however, might have been a factor, an official at the
airport meteorological service in the Croatian capital of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zagreb</ENAMEX>
told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> news agency.
<p>
   ``Conditions were very bad,'' the official said. ``Visibility
was poor  &MD;  about 1,000 meters (3,300 feet) which is very bad.
<p>
   ``Vertical visibility was 300 feet, which is extremely bad.
Coupled with pouring rain it's extremely bad conditions,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s trip came amid mounting concern that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">six months</TIMEX> of peace
in the region could soon come unraveled without a massive inflow of
public and private investment to help rebuild <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL ADD FOLLOWS
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX>'s mission was one of renewal, of trying to help rebuild
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia-Herzegovina</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Theis</ENAMEX>, a spokesman at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">World
Bank</ENAMEX>. The international development organization estimates it will
cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.1 billion</NUMEX> over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">next four years</TIMEX> to rebuild <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>'s
economic and social foundations.
<p>
   The hope, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theis</ENAMEX> said, is that the sort of private investment
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s mission was meant to encourage will twin with public funds
to help people get off the battlefields and back to work across the
war-torn region.
<p>
   ``I wouldn't call <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> a safe bet for business investment, but
I wouldn't call it high-risk either,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theis</ENAMEX>. As <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s
crash underscored, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Theis</ENAMEX> said, ``Nothing is certain there.''
<p>
   For Americans, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s crash was an ugly reminder of the
unpredictable perils of peacemaking in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, where more American
civilians have now died than soldiers.
<p>
   Despite the evident dangers of deploying 20,000 American troops
as part of an overall <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NATO</ENAMEX> peacekeeping mission in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, there
have been just two military fatalities  &MD;  one caused by a land mine
and the other by a vehicle accident  &MD;  since the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troops went to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">three months ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   As diplomats struggled to end the war <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last August</TIMEX>, Assistant
Secretary of State <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Frasure</ENAMEX>, Deputy Assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX>
Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Kruzel</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">S. Nelson Drew</ENAMEX> were
killed when the armored personnel carrier in which they were riding
crashed and burned while en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sarajevo</ENAMEX> over the treacherous
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mount Igman</ENAMEX> road.
<p>
   For the people of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s plane crash was yet
another painful chapter in a long series of tribulations stemming
from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">three and a half years</TIMEX> of war.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s visit had been a symptom of peace and a symbol of hope
that the region might rise from the ashes of destruction. Even the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport, shelled to ruin by Bosnian Serbs, had only
recently been rebuilt, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s visit to the medieval port town
raised hopes for a return of the tourists that in peacetime account
for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the region's economic activity.
<p>
   ``It was just so encouraging to see American businessmen, and
especially a delegation headed by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX>, go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nazli P. Weiss</ENAMEX>, executive vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rebuild
Dubrovnik Fund</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``The idea was to sort of jump-start tourism,'' she said. ``This
is really a very big disappointment and tragedy.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">New York Times</ENAMEX> publisher <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Sulzberger, Jr.</ENAMEX>, sent a letter
to staffers saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Times</ENAMEX> reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel Nash</ENAMEX> had been on
board <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s aircraft and was killed.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and 32 others on a
Balkan trade mission were presumed killed when their plane slammed
into a Croatian hillside during heavy storms <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Authorities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> blamed the crash on bad
weather, not hostile fire or sabotage. The plane  &MD;  a military
version of the twin-engine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737  &MD;  disappeared from radar
screens just minutes before it was to have landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>'s
airport. There was no indication of problems before the crash.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> spokesman said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was
assumed dead, although officially the passengers were still listed
as missing. And an official of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Riggs National Bank</ENAMEX>, one of whose
vice presidents was on board, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX>: ``We have
been told that the crash left no survivors.''
<p>
   Journalists who reached the crash site reported that one woman
had been found alive but died while being rushed to a hospital by
helicopter. The plane was resting on its belly, the middle portion
burned out.
<p>
   Rescue workers with flashlights searched the area in pouring
rain <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, and Croatian commanders at the scene told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The
New York Times</ENAMEX> they had found nine bodies.
<p>
   There were 33 people on board the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> T-43, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, 54, other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> officials, American business executives
and a crew of six.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">New York Times</ENAMEX> reporter <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel Nash</ENAMEX> was also on board, the
paper said.
<p>
   The plane crashed in extremely windy weather as it prepared to
land after a 45-minute flight from the Bosnian town of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX> at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:52 p.m. Croatian time</TIMEX> (<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:52 a.m. PST</TIMEX>). For reasons yet unknown,
the plane came in north of the runway and struck the hillside.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, accompanied by top business executives, was in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> to encourage American investment in a region torn by war
and badly in need of business to rebuild its economy. As of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late
Wednesday night</TIMEX>, the administration had not released a full list of
people on the flight.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, expressing shock and dismay, canceled his
regular schedule. He and first lady <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> visited
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alma</ENAMEX>, and son, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael</ENAMEX>, at the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> home. Afterward,
the president paid tribute to his friend and ally in a speech to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> employees.
<p>
   ``He was one of the best advisers and ablest people I ever knew.
And he was very, very good at everything he ever did,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
said of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Harlem</ENAMEX>-raised former civil rights activist,
lawyer-lobbyist and chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Democratic National Committee</ENAMEX>,
who became one of the highest-ranking blacks ever to serve in
government.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> walked and ran and flew through life, and he was a
magnificent life force. And those of us who loved him will always
be grateful for his friendship and his warmth,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
speaking in somber tones to about 700 employees in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>
auditorium. He was flanked on stage by his wife, other cabinet
members and Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said that he had asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s wife what he should say
in his remarks and that she had replied: ``Tell them <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron</ENAMEX> was proud
of them, that he liked them, that he believed in them, and that he
fought for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>, and tell them that you're going
to do that now.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Good</ENAMEX>, undersecretary of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">commerce</ENAMEX> for technology, was named
the acting head of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> is one of the departments that the Republican majority
in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has targeted for closing, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> has been a frequent
target of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GOP</ENAMEX> barbs. A controversial figure, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> was accused
twice of financial improprieties, cleared in one case, and under
investigation by an independent counsel in the second.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell Estes</ENAMEX>, director of
operations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, dismissed ground fire or
sabotage as a cause of the crash, saying ``we would rule anything
out of that type.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> stressed that the weather was bad, with high winds.
<p>
   ``There were no calls made indicating any kind of a problem on
board the aircraft. They were in contact with the tower, making
their approach, when contact was lost,'' he said.
<p>
   There were initial reports that plane parts were found at sea,
near the airport on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic</ENAMEX> coast. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> special
forces searching the area had found no floating wreckage. The crash
site was on a hill about 2 miles north of the airport, he said.
<p>
   The ill-fated plane was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, acquired by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> and given a thorough maintenance overhaul <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX>. It was
the same plane used within the past few weeks for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX>'s trip to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> and a visit by the first lady
and her daughter to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Woodard</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Commercial Airplane Group</ENAMEX>,
had been scheduled to join the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> mission to promote trade in
the war-ravaged region, but was still in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> when the crash
took place.
<p>
   The aircraft had 17,000 flying hours under its belt, and the 737
has ``a very, very good safety record,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Estes</ENAMEX> said. Two civilian
737s have crashed in recent years  &MD;  one in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and one in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and neither crash has been fully explained, despite
intense investigations.
<p>
   Before the flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> had visited <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> peacekeeping troops in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tuzla</ENAMEX>, bringing sports videos and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> hamburgers. He was
accompanied on that part of the trip by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonald's</ENAMEX> executives.
<p>
   ``Being a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> man myself, I know what being away from
home is like. So we thought we would bring a little bit of home to
you,'' he told the troops.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s friends and allies reacted with shock as they waited for
word on the fate of the passengers.
<p>
   ``This is a man whose multiple talents will not easily be
replaced,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eleanor Holmes Norton</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">District of Columbia</ENAMEX>'s
delegate to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane went down in the line of duty. ... Not
only is he an excellent emissary on behalf of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States of
America</ENAMEX>, he has been an exemplary role model for American youth,''
said Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cynthia McKinney</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ga.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``I am personally devastated. ... I have worked closely with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron
Brown</ENAMEX> over the years and I consider him a close personal friend as
well as a strong advocate for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> state and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific
Northwest</ENAMEX>,'' Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patty Murray</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, said in a written
statement.
<p>
   Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norm Dicks</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX>, said: ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> loved <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>
state, its natural resources, and its trade-dependent economy. ...
He was the premier administration official pushing for sale of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> aircraft to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>, and he became personally involved
with our delegation in bringing federal disaster assistance funding
to Northwest fishermen.''

<p>
   The military version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 that crashed in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was not equipped with either a cockpit voice recorder or
a flight data recorder, two crucial tools investigators use to
determine the cause of plane crashes.
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> spokesman confirmed that the T-43 had neither of of
the so-called ``black boxes.''
<p>
   ``I don't think we're ever going to hear a lot about'' the cause
of ``this one,'' said one highly placed aviation accident
investigator not involved in the T-43 inquiry.
<p>
   The plane, the only one of its kind at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein Air Base</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, was used to transport ``distinguished visitors'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>
and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>. In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hillary Rodham Clinton</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clintons</ENAMEX>' daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chelsea</ENAMEX>, had used the plane to fly to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Turkey</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> had used it while
flying in and out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bosnia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> sources said.
<p>
   The military plane is almost a copy of the 737, the workhorse of
commercial aviation, except for fewer windows, many more antennas
and a reinforced floor to support heavy military equipment.
<p>
   While the plane has developed an excellent safety record in
commercial aviation in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last 30 years</TIMEX>, it has been involved in
two fatal crashes while on landing approaches that safety
specialists have been unable to explain.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plane that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was on a landing
approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Officials have said the plane was not shot down. But without the
black boxes, they will be severely hampered in their investigation
of the crash.
<p>
   The black boxes are critical because the cockpit voice recorder
is a tape that continuously records the most recent 30 minutes. The
flight data recorder, depending on its age, can trace anywhere from
six to more than 70 key aircraft functions ranging from speed to
flap settings.
<p>
   Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, there have been 76 domestic accidents involving the
737, eight of which involved fatalities, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The safety board has been unable to identify the cause of two of
them. One was a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 3, 1991</TIMEX>, crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 that
crashed on final approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, killing all 25 on

<p>
   The other was the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8, 1994</TIMEX>, crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> Flight 427,
which plummeted to the ground while on approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greater
Pittsburgh International Airport</ENAMEX>, killing all 132 people aboard.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> flight had an older flight data recorder, and the safety
board has urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> to require 737s
to have newer flight data recorders that can monitor many more
functions, including rudder movement.
<p>
   Sudden rudder movement, which could cause the plane to roll and
dive toward the ground, is a possibility in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> crashes. A freak wind phenomenon also is considered a
possible cause of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX> crash.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spent several months investigating the 737s
and found no design flaw that could have caused either crash.
<p>
   The T-43 that crashed was one of the few used for personnel
transport. Most of the 19 purchased by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1974</TIMEX> have been used to train aviators in navigation.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> suggested on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that malfunctioning instruments may have caused the crash
of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> jet that took the life of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron
Brown</ENAMEX> and at least 32 others in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Returning from a trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Egypt</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> told reporters on his
plane: ``It was a classic sort of accident that good
instrumentation should be able to prevent.''
<p>
   He did not specify whether he was referring to instruments on
the ground or in the plane. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane, a military version of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737, smashed into a mountain near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, the storied
port on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Adriatic Sea</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE|TIME" STATUS="OPT">More than 36 hours after the crash</TIMEX>, it was still not clear how
many passengers were aboard, though it was evident there were no
survivors. After rescue teams searched all <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> and all
day on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, hampered by fog and rain, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Miomir Zuzul</ENAMEX>, the
Croatian ambassador to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, said they had discovered
33 bodies. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> used the same figure.
<p>
   But the plane's manifest, issued by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, listed
35 people: <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX> and 11 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce Department</ENAMEX> aides, including
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles F. Meissner</ENAMEX>, assistant secretary for international trade,
whose wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doris</ENAMEX>, heads the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Immigration and Naturalization
Service</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Morton</ENAMEX>, deputy assistant secretary for
international economic development; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lee F. Jackson</ENAMEX>, an American
working at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</ENAMEX>;
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James M. Lewek</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX> analyst; a
photographer and an interpreter from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Embassy</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Zagreb</ENAMEX>; 12 business executives; 6 crewmen; and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nathaniel C. Nash</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX> bureau chief of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The New York Times</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Unable to fully explain the discrepancy, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glyn Davies</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State
Department</ENAMEX> spokesman said at an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> briefing: ``We've made
every effort with regards to this list to confirm its accuracy, and
there are no indications that anyone listed on this manifest was
not on the plane that crashed.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davies</ENAMEX> added on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>: ``The condition of the remains
is such that it's difficult to say with certainty that there are 33
or 35 bodies there.''
<p>
   The cause of the crash was no clearer on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> than on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, but a few more details emerged. It was established, for
example, that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cilipi Airport</ENAMEX>, southeast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, had no
instrument landing system  &MD;  the sophisticated aid to bad-weather
navigation that major airports use. It was a casualty of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>
war. But the airport has a less advanced system, a VHF
Omnidirectional Radio beacon, or VOR, that should have sufficed.
<p>
   ``People in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> say that it was the worst storm they have
seen in a decade,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Galbraith</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> ambassador to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>. ``The plane was obviously not where it should have been.
It seems to have flown up, not along the coast but along a valley
one ridge over.''
<p>
   Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howell Estes</ENAMEX>, director of operations for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Joint
Chiefs of Staff</ENAMEX>, said that many aircraft had landed at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cilipi</ENAMEX>
without difficulty, including several during the foul weather on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, both before and after the accident.
<p>
   No one disputed that the plane was almost two miles off course.

<p>
   After 12 American executives perished along with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX>
Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald H. Brown</ENAMEX> when their plane slammed into a Croatian
hillside in bad weather <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, their companies faced a common
crisis: keeping the businesses on course in an emotional maelstrom.
<p>
   Co-workers of the victims in companies from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX> to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> struggled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to hold back tears while performing
mundane duties such as answering the phone. Others began the
difficult task of planning how to replace the dead and notifying
fellow employees of the devastating news.
<p>
   The tragedy  &MD;  believed to be the largest collective loss of top
corporate executives in the country's history  &MD;  emphasized the
importance of succession policies and the increasingly standard
practice even at relatively small companies of not allowing more
than one executive aboard the same plane at the same time.
<p>
   Though none of the companies were prepared for the crisis, some
were suffering more than others in trying to operate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``This is a small company of 30 people. So it's been hit very,
very hard. There are not systems in place for an emergency of this
magnitude,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bradley Inman</ENAMEX>, a friend of former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> professor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">I. Donald Terner</ENAMEX>,
56, who died in the crash. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terner</ENAMEX> founded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">BRIDGE Housing Corp.</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>-based nonprofit development concern that builds
affordable housing.
<p>
   ``Succession has not been resolved,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Inman</ENAMEX> said. ``Business
meetings have been canceled. The doors are open and employees are
working, but it's not business as usual by any means.''
<p>
   As corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> goes global, the list of those grappling
with these issues has grown.
<p>
   A business trip for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conoco</ENAMEX> resulted in nine deaths <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years
ago</TIMEX>, including half of the oil concern's senior managers. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael
Eisner</ENAMEX>, CEO of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Walt Disney Co.</ENAMEX>, lost an ally who helped build
the company when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Wells</ENAMEX> died in a helicopter crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
And <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Donald Trump</ENAMEX> lost three executives in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, also in a
helicopter disaster. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sam and Jim Snyder</ENAMEX>, owners of a
plastics firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockland</ENAMEX>, died when their single-engine plane
crashed on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Interstate 495</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wareham</ENAMEX>, also killing a mother and her
4-year-old daughter.
<p>
    &UR;  &LR; Across the country <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, some businesses shut their doors
for the remainder of the work week out of respect for those who
perished during the trade mission, part of the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 billion</NUMEX>
reconstruction effort intended to restore the torn Bosnian
landscape into something resembling a normal society, with roads,
housing, utilities and employment opportunities.
<p>
   Flags outside corporate headquarters were lowered to half-staff
and companies struggled to maintain professionalism while dealing
with their loss.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harvey Levy</ENAMEX>, spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster Wheeler Corp.</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Clinton</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>, said the company was trying to carry on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> without vice
president <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Whittaker</ENAMEX>. The company did announce a temporary
successor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Henry E. Bartoli</ENAMEX>, effective immediately.
<p>
   ``Business is continuing as usual,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> said. ``I'm afraid it
has to.''
<p>
   Although <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whittaker</ENAMEX>, 48, was the only <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Foster Wheeler</ENAMEX> executive on
the plane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> said employees were questioning whether the company
had any formal policy prohibiting those at the top from traveling
on the same aircraft together.
<p>
   ``I don't know if there's a formal policy on that,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Levy</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Berger</ENAMEX>, spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bechtel Group</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco</ENAMEX>-based engineering firm, confirmed that the company had a
succession plan following the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">P. Stuart Tholan</ENAMEX>, president
of the company's overseas divisions. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tholan</ENAMEX>, 59 and a resident of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>, was manager of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s Central Artery/Third Harbor Tunnel
project until assuming his latest position in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``At this time in particular, we're just not prepared to talk at
length about succession except to say we certainly have succession
planning,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Berger</ENAMEX> said. ``It's an important part of our business  &MD; 
anyone's business.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> natural gas company <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enserch Corp.</ENAMEX> lowered its flag
before it received official confirmation of the death of
50-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank A. Maier</ENAMEX>, a subsidiary president.
<p>
   ``Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Maier</ENAMEX> was a very valued employee, but we do have a
succession plan. His work will continue on in his memory,''
spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Matson</ENAMEX> said. The company has not named a
replacement, nor did <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matson</ENAMEX> know when that would happen. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Enserch</ENAMEX>
does have a policy prohibiting more than one top executive from
flying on the same plane.
<p>
   A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> survey by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runzheimer International</ENAMEX> showed that two-thirds
of the largest <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> corporations have policies limiting the number of
executives who can travel together. However, such policies are less
common in smaller companies. Overall, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">59 percent</NUMEX> of companies do
not limit the number of employees who travel together, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Runzheimer</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   The safety chief, Brig. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orin Godsey</ENAMEX>, said equipping the
plane with the recorder would have cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" STATUS="OPT">several million dollars</NUMEX>.
Other officers put the figure at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$7 million</NUMEX>, one ten-thousandth of
the service's annual budget of more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$70 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>'s policy, established in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>, was that we would
equip all new aircraft that we purchase with flight data
recorders,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godsey</ENAMEX> said in an interview. The military <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737
that crashed was built in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Our goal was to retrofit them all,'' he said. ``Because of
budget problems it's an impossibility.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> recommended in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>
that the military should equip all aircraft ``used primarily to
transport passengers with state-of-the-art cockpit voice recorders
and digital flight data recorders.'' The goal was ``effective
accident investigation,'' the board said.
<p>
   There are many other questions that doubtless will be answered
as the inquiry into the crash proceeds:
<p>
    &MD;  How experienced were these pilots with the approach to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, with the kind of weather they faced and with the
Croatian air traffic control procedures?
<p>
    &MD;  How many flights had they flown, and how much rest had they
gotten, in previous days? Had they often flown together before, or
were they fairly newly paired?
<p>
    &MD;  What arrangements had they made for a secondary landing site
in the event that the weather at their destination deteriorated
below safe minimums?
<p>
   The group has even developed a checklist to use in assessing the
risks inherent in various types of flights. Many of the problems
facing the crew of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>'s plane are cited as important risk
factors on that checklist: the airport's reliance on a
nondirectional beacon as its only aid to navigation by instruments;
the fact that the controllers and pilots spoke different native
languages (although they would have communicated in English); the
airport's location near mountains; the fact that the plane was not
a regularly scheduled flight; the airport's location in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern
Europe</ENAMEX>, and the bad weather.
<p>
   Aviation experts say that most crashes are caused by more than
one factor, and that some of the factors likely to be blamed for
this crash are probably on that list.

TESTS SHOW LANDING BEACON FUNCTIONED IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CROATIA</ENAMEX> CRASH

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Officials of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>
have tested the Croatian radio beacon that was presumably being
used by the plane carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> when it
crashed on approach to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport and ``found the
landing beacon signal to be functioning properly during the
tests,'' the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> officials not directly involved in the investigation
also said the plane's pilot and co-pilot were very familiar with
landings using the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport's type of beacon, though
neither had landed at the airport before.
<p>
   ``We believe at this time we have the right training and the
right experience level in those aircraft,'' Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph E.
Eberhart</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> Deputy Chief of Staff for plans and
operations, said at a briefing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   He said that crews on aircraft used for ``distinguished
visitors'' were required to complete 52 landing approaches a year,
half with the relatively unsophisticated navigation equipment that
did not give electronic guidance on the proper descent altitude.
<p>
   Many of those training flights involve beacons like the ones at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, equipment that is common in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eberhart</ENAMEX> is not a member of the accident investigation
board, and he and other officials said that final conclusions would
have to come from the board.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> is already moving to dispel possible criticism,
including questions about why the plane had no flight data recorder
or cockpit voice recorder, the crash-proof ``black boxes'' that
investigators rely on in most commercial crashes.
<p>
   At the briefing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, Brigadier Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Orin L. Godsey</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> chief of safety, said the absence of these instruments would
``complicate'' the investigation, but he added, ``Because of the
technology we have <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, we will be able to replicate almost the
entire realm'' of information a box would have provided.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Godsey</ENAMEX> was not able to provide specifics. He said, for
example, that he did not know if AWACS, or Airborne
Warning-and-Control System, had traced the final approach of the
commerce secretary's plane, a military version of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737.
<p>
   On board the plane were 27 American passengers, two Croatians
and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> crew of six.
<p>
   The board looking into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> crash has ``nearly
completed'' locating and documenting the wreckage and identifying
aircraft components, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> said. But officials would not
predict when the team will return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, where
analyses will be done, or when it would report.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 11</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> will review its regulations on non-pilots flying
planes following a crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in which a 7-year-old girl and her
father died when their plane crashed shortly after takeoff.
<p>
   ``I have asked the associate administrator that ... he review
the appropriate federal aviation regulations pertinent to the
manipulation of flight controls by non-pilots'' after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> completes its investigation of the
crash of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX> said
in an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> press conference.
<p>
   Investigators haven't determined what caused <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>'s
crash just north of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wisconsin</ENAMEX>. Killed in the accident
were <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>, her father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Dubroff</ENAMEX>, and flight
instructor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joe Reid</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubroff</ENAMEX> was attempting to become the youngest
pilot ever to make a round-trip, cross-country flight, and her
plane took off in the middle of a thunderstorm.
<p>
   Technically, though, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> was the pilot-in-command of the
flight, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said. As such, he should have allowed the young girl
to operate the aircraft only if he felt it was safe for her to do
so.
<p>
   ``The view we have here is that (regulations) require that the
pilot-in-command be responsible for the safe flight of the aircraft
and that non-pilots, whether they are 7 or 97 years old, manipulate
the controls only when it is safe to do so,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   A person must be 16 years old to get a pilot's license. Balloon
and glider licenses are issued to qualified people who are at least
14 years old.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator expressed his condolences to the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dubroff</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> families. He also urged that people wait until the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>
completes its investigation before speculating that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>
may have been responsible for the crash.
<p>

NO FEDERAL RULE BARS YOUNG PILOTS FROM LEARNING

<p>
   Seven-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica Dubroff</ENAMEX>, who died <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Cessna</ENAMEX> she was flying crashed as she attempted to become the
youngest pilot to fly across the country, was still nine years shy
of being a legal student pilot.
<p>
   Under federal aviation regulations, a person must be 16 before
getting a student license. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>
historically has looked the other way whenever children climb into
the cockpit in search of a record.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David R. Hinson</ENAMEX> said the agency will
reevaluate the regulations governing youngsters in the cockpit.
<p>
   Under current regulations, all flights with children at the
controls also must have a certified flight instructor in the
cockpit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> considers the certified instructor on board to be
the pilot ``responsible for the control and safe flight of the
aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   But with the death of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX>, her father <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lloyd Dubroff</ENAMEX> and her
flight instructor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Reid</ENAMEX>, a review will be conducted by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX>, associate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator for regulation and
certification, to see if the regulations are adequate.
<p>
   The issue has been debated within the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> for some time,
officials said.
<p>
   ``For some people, mostly pilots, this was a macho sort of thing
that teaches kids how to fly and generates interest in aviation,''
said a former career <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official who did not want to be named.
<p>
   ``But this is so patently stupid. You've got to be 16 to drive a
car and 16 to fly a plane. All this does is make people try it
again and again at a younger and younger age.''
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren Morningstar</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aircraft Owner and Pilot's
Association</ENAMEX>, said, ``There is no great need to change regulations
with regard to children, the middle-aged or the elderly flying with
a certified flight instructor because they want to learn about
flying safely,'' he said.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Morningstar</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the 340,000-member general
aviation lobbying group, added, ``We have a problem with children
being put in a position to try and set a pseudo-record. We have
never endorsed these stunt flights and unfortunately, we saw the
results <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> of what happens when you put a person, for whatever
reason for fame or attention, under extraordinary pressure and they
do things they would not otherwise have done.''
<p>
   Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials said the pursuit of records is nothing more
than a con, because licensed pilots were doing most of the flying.
<p>
   ``You could put someone like her in the right-hand seat and say
she is flying, but it is the person in the left seat who is
flying,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Herwig</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Cessna</ENAMEX> took off in rain and snow from the 6,900-foot
runway at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cheyenne Municipal Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wyoming</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX> was seated at
one control panel, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jessica</ENAMEX> was seated at another and her father was
in a passenger seat in a four-seat <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> 177B, a 21-year-old
single-engine plane owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reid</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``A flight instructor is required to be in a position to take
complete control of an aircraft in an instant when flying with an
unlicensed student,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Pile</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> is investigating the
accident and will try to determine who was controlling the plane as
it plummeted 400 feet to the ground, less than a mile from the
airport.
<p>
   One high-ranking safety investigator said he did not question
whether children should be flying planes, but rather the decision
to take off in such poor weather conditions.
<p>
   ``She was flying with a certified flight instructor and I
guarantee he took it away from her at the first sign of trouble,''
he said. ``They probably should not have left because of the
conditions, but they might have felt driven to leave because of the
record and the cameras were rolling.''

<p>
   Despite the spectacular failure of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s new generation Long
March 3B satellite launch vehicle in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> aero-space giant
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> still plans to use it to launch its ChinaStar 1
satellite in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second half of next year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We have the normal concerns but are confident the launch will
be successful,'' the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin, North Asia</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Young</ENAMEX>, said.
<p>
   ``The Long March programme as a whole has been pretty successful
and we have established a good working relationship with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China
Great Wall</ENAMEX> [the mainland's satellite launch company],'' Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   Two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX> satellites were launched successfully using
Long March 2E rockets in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said it was not unusual for new launch vehicles to fail
on their first or second launch and predicted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> would continue
to win customers for its launch programme.
<p>
   ``At the moment, demand for satellite launches exceeds supply so
anyone who can offer reasonable costs and a good schedule will be
successful,'' he said.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> has the additional advantage of having domestic
customers to fill in the gaps between international launches,'' he
said.
<p>
   As yet, it is unknown how far insurance premiums will increase
as a result of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> disaster but Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> was confident
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX> still would be able to offer competitive pricing.
<p>
   The investigation into the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>'s failure should
end <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX>, who was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beijing</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> for the opening of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lockheed Martin</ENAMEX>'s representative office, said the company planned
to consolidate and expand its business interests throughout <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In addition to satellites, it has an aircraft maintenance joint
venture in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Guangzhou</ENAMEX> and hopes to become involved in airport
development, airport management and air traffic control systems.
<p>
   Mr <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said the ambitious air infrastructure development
projects in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">China</ENAMEX>'s Ninth Five-Year Plan would expand opportunites.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> investigators contend three F-14 fighter
crashes in recent months are not connected, service officials said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> they are taking steps to prevent future accidents.
<p>
   After record safety years in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s aircraft
program was shaken <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early this year</TIMEX> by three F-14 crashes in just
four weeks. Naval investigators have concluded that two of the
crashes were caused by pilot error. A third is under investigation.
<p>
   ``At this point, we still do not believe there is a common
thread,'' Adm. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jay L. Johnson</ENAMEX>, vice chief of naval operations, told
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House National Security Committee</ENAMEX>'s procurement subcommittee.
<p>
   ``The causes of aircraft mishaps are varied and complex,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said. ``Sometimes we find human error. Sometimes we find
mechanical problems. Often it's a combination of both. And
sometimes, despite everyone's best efforts, the cause remains
undetermined.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last Friday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said pilot error was to blame for
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 29</TIMEX> crash of a jet fighter in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> which killed the
pilot, his back-seat crewmember and three people on the ground. The
plane's pilot, trying to show off for his parents who were watching
from the ground, attempted a steep takeoff and lost his bearings,
investigators found.
<p>
   Investigators blame the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 22</TIMEX> crash of an F-14 into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> on pilot error. Both the pilot and crewmember
survived. A third crash, in which both crewmen died when their
plane crashed off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX> coast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 18</TIMEX>, is under
investigation.
<p>
   Since the crashes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has eliminated a program that
allowed navigators, weapons experts and radio officers to become
pilots. The program was blamed for creating pilots who  &MD;  because of
their previous experience in the back seat  &MD;  were thought to have
more flying expertise than they actually did.
<p>
   The service is installing a new cockpit light that warns pilots
of impending engine failure and has put strict limits on the use of
the F-14's powerful afterburners. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> also is reviewing its
training and ejection procedures.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> decided not to replace the F-14's
engines because the fighters are scheduled to go out of service by
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">2004</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``We made the decision not to upgrade the engines because they
would be too expensive to put in an aircraft which would be removed
from service a few years after being re-engined,'' he told the
committee.
<p>
   Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Duncan Hunter</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calif.</ENAMEX>, said he is concerned that money
needed to improve military equipment instead is being used to boost
personnel and operations accounts.
<p>
   ``We must ask if there are things the services could have done
to improve the safety of these aircraft but were unable to do
because of a lack of modernization resources,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>, the
panel's chairman. ``Are the services in the difficult position of
having to choose between combat upgrades or safety improvements?''
he asked.
<p>
   Under questioning from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> Lt. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harold W.
Blot</ENAMEX>, deputy chief of staff for aviation, said lack of money led
the service to curtail a safety upgrade program for AV-8B Harriers.
Four of the planes that did not receive the upgrade have crashed
since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 1</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> are refurbishing the Harriers with a new engine,
radar and other features in part because the jets have one of the
worst accident rates among all military aircraft. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blot</ENAMEX> said the
upgrade has sliced Harrier accident rates in half.
<p>
   While the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marines</ENAMEX> fly 181 jump jets, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Blot</ENAMEX> said 24 aircraft won't
get the safety improvements ``because of the fiscal constraints
that were placed on the program.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hunter</ENAMEX> said he will consider adding money to the defense budget
for the Harrier improvement program.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> has ordered that
new recording devices and safety equipment be installed on military
aircraft that carry passengers, after investigators found no sign
so far that major components failed on the plane that crashed in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 3</TIMEX>, killing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and 34
others, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> official said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The official said the crash, which killed all on board, occurred
in weather good enough for a landing at the field and not at all
unusual for the area. ``The weather reported at the time was above
minimums for this approach,'' said the official, who spoke at a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> briefing on condition of anonymity.
<p>
   The official said that no evidence has emerged of any
malfunction in the rudder, the part that is suspected in the crash
of two civilian 737's, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> plane in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> and a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> plane in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The official said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Perry</ENAMEX> ordered the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 9</TIMEX> to install airline-type navigation and recording
devices, along with some advanced navigation equipment that is not
yet in wide use among the airlines, on all military planes that
carry passengers.
<p>
   The plane in the Croatian crash, a slightly modified <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737,
did not have a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder, or
equipment that would have let it use the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s navigation
satellites. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> said the reason was cost.
<p>
   It did have a ground proximity warning system, which sounds an
alarm if the plane is too low, but the senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> official
said that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> secretary was now ordering far more advanced
versions, which include a computer database of terrain all over the
world. The advanced device couples the database with knowledge of
the plane's position, speed and direction, to give 60 seconds
warning if it is heading into a mountain.
<p>
   The official said that all the services had been told to report
back to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">defense</ENAMEX> secretary by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> on which planes did not
have cockpit voice recorders and flight data recorders. Though
these devices do not prevent plane crashes, they are invaluable for
investigating them.
<p>
   On the Croatian hillside where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plane went down,
investigators are removing instruments from the shattered cockpit
and shipping them back to the manufacturers, in hope of determining
the instruments' last readings, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> official said.
<p>
   Some members of the 12-member accident review board have already
left for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ramstein</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, and others are still working at the
scene. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> plans to take another T-43a to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> at
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of this month</TIMEX> to fly the approach repeatedly, the official
said.
<p>
   That plane carries a radio-receiver that can be tuned to pick up
signals from one of two radio beacons on the ground. The beacons
are an old technology that is in wide use in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">eastern Europe</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has tested the beacons at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> and found them
working at the time of the test.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 17</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World
Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>'s software for setting fares was so outdated that
information on more than 800 daily departures from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> had to
be figured by hand.
<p>
   Then, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> spent <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> on a program that automatically sets
a profitable mix of fares. The airline expects the change to boost
revenue <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100 million</NUMEX> a year.
<p>
   After huge losses, two bankruptcies and years of neglect the
nation's No. 7 airline is battling back.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has not been a normal company,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Peiser</ENAMEX>, chief
financial officer. ``You've had decades of no investment.''
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">next four years</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> will spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 billion</NUMEX> for 20 new
planes. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">This year</TIMEX> alone, it will hire 500 flight attendants, 300
pilots and 1,300 reservations agents. And it's adjusting routes to
focus on the most profitable flights and computerizing scheduling
for flight crews.
<p>
   The goal: To regain its share of the business-travel market,
remaking itself as a low cost, full-service carrier.
<p>
   In a sign of the turnaround, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> said its a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-quarter</TIMEX>
loss narrowed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$37.1 million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$122.8 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX>,
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">fifth straight quarter</TIMEX> of improvement.
<p>
   Of course, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> is hardly a sure thing. A recession, air disaster
or political instability could wipe out any chance the 71-year-old
carrier has of making it, analysts say.
<p>
   ``If anything goes wrong of significant consequence, like
another <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Iraq</ENAMEX> invading <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kuwait</ENAMEX> or another round of terrorist
bombings, I don't think <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has built the kind of foundation that
would enable them to survive,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Scott Hamilton</ENAMEX>, editor of
trade publication Commercial Aviation Report.
<p>
   Plenty of investors are betting that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s management is on the
right track. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s stock touched a post-bankruptcy high of 23 3/4
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Wednesday</TIMEX>, more than five times its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">mid-August</TIMEX> low of 4.
<p>
   Investors expect big savings or revenue gains from minor
changes, such as upgrading its computer systems.
<p>
   ``There are so many things they can implement to make themselves
more efficient,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clarke Adams</ENAMEX>, co-manager of the Brandywine
Fund and portfolio manager with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friess Associates Inc.</ENAMEX>, which owned
1.74 million <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> shares at <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">year's end</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Plans to rebuild <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> were inconceivable just a few years ago.
<p>
   Bruised by an economic downturn on top of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>
crisis and former owner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX>'s sale of plum international
routes, the once-proud airline was in a tailspin.
<p>
   It filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection not once, but
twice.
<p>
   While the bankruptcies sullied its already tarnished name, they
gave the airline a chance to shed burdensome debt.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last August</TIMEX>, it emerged from bankruptcy No. 2 <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" MIN="$500 million">minus $500 million</NUMEX>
in debt. That dropped long-term debt to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.3 billion</NUMEX> and reduced
annual interest expense by <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX>. It also negotiated employee
concessions on work rules and benefits that save <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$130 million to
$140 million</NUMEX> a year.
<p>
   That gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> a chance to patch up its balance sheet and make
investments in new aircraft as it replaces its fleet, the oldest
among major airlines, analysts said.
<p>
   Its loss <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> narrowed to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$227.5 million</NUMEX> -- including
charges of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$155.8 million</NUMEX> -- from a loss of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$435.8 million</NUMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>.
Revenue fell <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">2.6 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.32 billion</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.41 billion</NUMEX>,
reflecting planned cuts in domestic and international capacity.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> ended <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$286.8 million</NUMEX> cash, more than twice as much
as the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$121.3 million</NUMEX> it had <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   That cash gives <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> room to make quick upgrades. One project in
the works: a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 million</NUMEX> automation of back-office accounting
operations and new inventory control systems at its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>, maintenance base.
<p>
   ``We're trying to catch up to where everybody's been,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peiser</ENAMEX>, adding that management is racing to get the company in
shape to withstand an inevitable economic downturn.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> pioneered <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> coast-to-coast air travel with a helping hand
from legendary aviator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Lindbergh</ENAMEX>, who scouted routes.
Another air industry legend, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Hughes</ENAMEX>, bought the carrier in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> and owned it for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">next 27 years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> floundered in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970s</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX> as part of a holding
company with interests in vending machines, hotels and fast-food
chains. Then corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> took control in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, winning a
takeover fight with airline executive <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Lorenzo</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> took <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> private in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, piling on debt and using money
that could have been earmarked for new aircraft and other equipment
at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> for investments in other businesses. He sold <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> route, gutting international service.
<p>
   The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1992</TIMEX> after
losing more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$920 million</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1990 through 1992</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX> left <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a
year later</TIMEX>, turning over control to longtime employees <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glenn Zander</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Wilson</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> emerged from the bankruptcy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Zander</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wilson</ENAMEX> left and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> hired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Erickson</ENAMEX>,
former president and chief executive of startup <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reno Air</ENAMEX>, as
president and CEO. The company also rehired <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peiser</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
executive who was working at turnaround firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bahadur, Balan &AMP;
Kazerski</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Finding that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s first restructuring plan saddled it with too
much debt, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peiser</ENAMEX> placed the company under bankruptcy
protection again in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1995</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The second bankruptcy rattled <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s bread-and-butter business
travelers, who had stuck with the carrier on the first trip to
bankruptcy court. Now, they booked flights on rival carriers.
<p>
   This was reflected in a drop in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first-quarter 1995</TIMEX> yield,
which measures how much a passenger pays to fly one mile, to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">10.9
cents</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">12 cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year earlier</TIMEX>.
<p>
   To woo business travelers, the airline <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last spring</TIMEX> launched a
premium service called Trans World One. It offers amenities such as
comforters and big pillows along with champagne and premium wines
on long flights at business-class fares.
<p>
   In its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first year</TIMEX>, Trans World One helped boost the percentage
of available seats actually sold to <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">72.2 percent</NUMEX> from a combined
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">53.5 percent</NUMEX> for business and first-class cabins from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year
earlier</TIMEX>, the airline said.
<p>
   ``<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Three years ago</TIMEX>, people were telling me I'd better use my
frequent flyer miles,'' said business traveler <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dave Guelker</ENAMEX> as he
stepped off a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City International Airport</ENAMEX>. ``I
haven't yet.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has gone down for the count twice. Even with customers like
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Guelker</ENAMEX>, it can't afford a third time.

<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">ALMOST five years after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lauda Air</ENAMEX> crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX> claimed
223 lives</TIMEX> investigators have returned to square one in trying to
determine what triggered the disaster.
<p>
   A year-long probe into a theory that the tragedy might have been
caused by electromagnetic interference from a camcorder, computer
or mobile phone has come to naught.
<p>
   The crash report on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s worst air disaster said the plane
plummeted when one of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767-300's reverse engines suddenly
cut in.
<p>
   A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> report by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Authority</ENAMEX> suggested
the malfunction could have been caused by interference from
electronic equipment. But exhaustive testing has been unable to
reproduce the problem.
<p>
   ``We cannot substantiate the claims. Our tests have not
generated any problems, our researchers have not found any
problems,'' a spokesman said from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``We have been getting people to switch on and off these
instruments while an aircraft is moving, but we have been unable to
reproduce the problem.
<p>
   ``It doesn't mean to say, however, that there is no problem. We
just haven't been able to prove it.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> was on a charter flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hong Kong</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> via
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bangkok</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 26, 1991</TIMEX>, when it crashed 160 kilometres northwest
of the Thai capital.
<p>
   A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1993</TIMEX> report by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aircraft Accident
Investigative Committee</ENAMEX> said the unintentional opening of the
plane's reverser - normally used to help brake on landing - had
made it veer violently while climbing at full power and at a
relatively low altitude.
<p>
   A legal spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lauda Air</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vienna</ENAMEX> said that the accident
commission had not launched a further investigation into the crash
based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aviation Authority</ENAMEX>'s <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> report.

<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>: change it represents. 
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shrontz</ENAMEX>, visionary: In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> had been CEO <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">for
three years</TIMEX> and chairman for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">two</TIMEX>. The economy was booming and the
company was selling jetliners faster than its 165,000 employees
could crank them out. The soon-to-fly 747-400 figured to solidify
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s monopoly on the lucrative jumbo-jet market. The company
won accolades all around; it was in the top tier of the Fortune
500.
<p>
   Inside, however, as the 747-400 suffered more teething problems
than an elephant with gum disease, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> was on a new mission:
reinventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> and the way it did business.
<p>
   ``We started this change when things were going well,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX>
pointed out, ``and it was hard to convince some people that we
needed to do it.''
<p>
   First top executives, then managers, then front-line workers had
to attend factory tours and special classes and make hard-won
commitments to do business differently. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> was already more
efficient than any other aerospace firm, especially among
commercial producers. But those firms, weaned on cost-plus defense
contracts and Cold War largesse, were not an efficient group.
<p>
   Executives under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> preached the gospel, but the word came
from him. The 777, designed and built in the new, participatory,
customer- and employee-focused style, became <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s most
trouble-free launch ever. Airlines responded by giving it more than
<NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">70 percent</NUMEX> of its market segment.
<p>
   To <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX>, this is his achievement: ``the start of what I think
is an important cultural change, to emphasize process as well as
product.'' In the end, he hopes, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> will turn out better jets
in less time and at less cost.
<p>
   But at the crowning moment, the successful first flight of the
new 777 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX>, there was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Shrontz</ENAMEX>, small-town guy, whipping
out a small camera to snap a picture of the huge twin-engine jet
lifting off the runway. The project was corporate <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>; the grin
was a kid from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Idaho</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   There are some regrets. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s brief ownership of Canadian
regional aircraft maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">de Havilland</ENAMEX> was a small disaster.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> also says he wishes he had started reinventing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> a
little sooner. ``I would like to have done some of these cultural
changes earlier. I am delighted that it's moving forward.''
<p>
   He also regrets the lost jobs, the lives changed.
<p>
   ``It is hard. Those are tough decisions and the results tear at
you. But if we don't do it, none of us in the company would have
jobs,'' he said. ``When your military business is down by half and
your commercial business is off by <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">30 percent</NUMEX>, I felt we had little
choice but to do what we did.
<p>
   ``We tried to modulate the impact'' of the layoffs, through an
early retirement offer, retraining, spreading out the layoffs over
time, instituting a hiring freeze, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``It's a lot more fun to manage when things are on the way up.''
<p>
   But he doesn't begrudge the pickets who've taken his name in
vain, the people who have mistaken his quiet demeanor for coldness.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> said he feels ``frustration, but not bitterness. I can
understand that they are looking at this thing from a different
perspective. I'm disappointed sometimes that our communication
isn't better.
<p>
   ``We used some unfortunate terms early on, like `shared
destiny.' People took that to mean that they wouldn't be leaving
here unless I was leaving here, too.''
<p>
   Union leaders generally say the company laid off more workers
than it needed to during the downsizing, and they still sometimes
question the company's commitment to its employees. But they don't
blame <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> for the hard times of the past few years. In fact,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Machinists</ENAMEX> union leaders credit <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> as being the catalyst in
settling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s strike.
<p>
   ``We have a lot of respect for him,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Johnson</ENAMEX>,
president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Association of Machinists &AMP; Aerospace
Workers District Lodge 751</ENAMEX>. ``As we were winding down in the last
days of the strike, he was instrumental in bringing the sides
together for an agreement. That was an attribute that's going to be
missed.''
<p>
   ``For a quiet, unassuming lawyer, he seems to have a lot of
vision,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Bofferding</ENAMEX>, executive director of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Professional Engineering Employees Association</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s
second-largest union. ``He's reorganized the company; he's forced a
kind of basic cultural change and a lot of it was during a time
when you could have argued, `Hey, things are fine.' ''
<p>
   One of his chief competitors, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> CEO <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harry
Stonecipher</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> shouldn't be underestimated.
<p>
   ``He tends to be softspoken, which people take for not being
tough. But he can be very tough,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stonecipher</ENAMEX> said. ``His
leadership at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has been absolutely remarkable. I like selling
with him better than selling against him.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> stops selling <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, but not working. He remains on the
boards of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Citicorp</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boise Cascade</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">3M</ENAMEX>, and on various other
boards, commissions and civic groups.
<p>
   He will continue to live on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mercer Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wash.</ENAMEX> His wife,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet</ENAMEX>, is a homemaker who has done volunteer work with the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle Art Museum</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Childhaven</ENAMEX>. In addition to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontzes</ENAMEX> have two other sons  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick</ENAMEX>, a social worker in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>,
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David</ENAMEX>, earning an MBA at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Seattle University</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and a
granddaughter.
<p>
   His stepping down means he'll be home more often. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harriet</ENAMEX> is a
little concerned about my being there,'' he acknowledged with a
grin. ``She wants me to know she may not be there as often.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shrontz</ENAMEX> loves to ski, and he hopes to make more family trips to
the slopes. ``I don't ski well,'' he allowed. ``And I don't like to
try to prove anything.''

CARE OF LAST FLYING B-29 A LABOR OF LOVE FOR VOLUNTEERS
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NYTimes News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">BARRY SHLACHTER</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIDLAND</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>  &MD;  An unforgiving <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">West Texas</ENAMEX> sun beat down as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Don
Davis</ENAMEX> strained to lift 103,000 pounds off the ground.
<p>
   After nearly six hours of tinkering on a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1945</TIMEX> electrical relay
switch the size of a soap bar, the B-29 crew chief finally managed
to get the No. 1 engine cowl flaps to open and shut so the silver
behemoth could once again take to the skies.
<p>
   ``The B-29 parts store has been closed a long time,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX>, 65, a tireless, heavyset man in oil-splotched <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Dickies</ENAMEX>
overalls and black gimme cap worn backward, explaining why he and a
half-dozen volunteers collectively spend tens of thousands of hours
repairing, scavenging and cannibalizing bits and pieces to keep the
world's only flying Superfortress airworthy.
<p>
   It's an endless challenge maintaining ``Fifi,'' the B-29's
nickname, given to honor the wife of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor Agather</ENAMEX>, the man who
rescued it from being a target at a bombing practice site in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mojave Desert</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">25 years ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The four-engine plane is alternately cursed and adored by people
who would rather spend their free time working on it than just
about anything. In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past year</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burleson</ENAMEX>-reared <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Looney</ENAMEX>, 42,
volunteered 1,500 hours on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate Air Force</ENAMEX>'s aging
bomber.
<p>
   ``It gets in your blood,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Bass</ENAMEX>, 72, a retired
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> oil land man who grew up in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>. ``It's sort of like
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Elks Club</ENAMEX> with an airplane.''
<p>
   The core group of volunteers lives in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Odessa</ENAMEX> area.
Others fly in at their own expense for the privilege of turning a
wrench on the rare bird.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benny Acock</ENAMEX>, 68, a former B-29 pilot, comes in regularly from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Corsicana</ENAMEX> despite occasional derision from friends back home.
<p>
   ``Some of them said, `You're just an old man trying to relive
the past.'
<p>
   ``I tell them: `That's wrong. I am an old man who is reliving
the past.'''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Warne</ENAMEX>, a 30-year-old computer technician from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hertfordshire</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>, spent his vacation <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> helping the
B-29 ground crew. ``My girlfriend was none too happy, but I
promised to take her to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bahamas</ENAMEX> next time,'' he said.
<p>
   ``Some people even work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thanksgiving</TIMEX> and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Christmas</TIMEX>. I know
because I was here,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neal Harrison</ENAMEX>, 37, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> gas plant
operator. ``I spend every spare moment here. My dad flew B-29s and
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">50 years later</TIMEX> I'm doing this. I wouldn't trade anything for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT" MIN="last five years">the
last five years of my life</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   But there's a downside.
<p>
   ``I sacrificed my family for this,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX>, who said his
wife moved out for four months over the time and attention he
afforded Fifi. ``She had all of the B-29  &MD;  &MD;  that she could take.
But we're putting it back together and she's getting involved
herself.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> businessman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">V. Neils Agather</ENAMEX>, 39, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAF</ENAMEX>'s B-29
squadron leader and son of the man who rescued the aircraft, said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harrison</ENAMEX>'s situation is not an isolated case.
<p>
   ``I hate to admit but we have had a lot of divorces in our midst
since I've been involved <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">20 years</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agather</ENAMEX> said. ``You see a lot
of marriages come and go.''
<p>
   Not counting labor, which is volunteer except for that of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Davis</ENAMEX>
and his assistant, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ken Sass</ENAMEX>, it costs roughly <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$500,000</NUMEX> a year to
keep Fifi running, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agather</ENAMEX> said. Much of that is raised from air
shows, the sale of souvenirs and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAF</ENAMEX> membership dues. The B-29 has
also appeared in six documentaries and feature films, including
``Fat Man and Little Boy'' and ``The Right Stuff,'' but often the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAF</ENAMEX> collects little more than the maintenance cost.
<p>
   ``In theory, we can always make the part. But in practice, I
have my doubts,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agather</ENAMEX> replied when asked how much longer Fifi
might be able to fly. ``In terms of people, there is that
generation that has no connection with World War II. Will they have
enough interest to come out and do what's needed?''
<p>
   Despite its crucial role in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> theater, the B-29 has
always been damned as a mechanic's nightmare.
<p>
   ``The hog, that's what we call it,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thad Dulin</ENAMEX>, 40, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX> oilfield drilling specialist and a recognized expert on the
B-29.
<p>
   ``Everything you do, it `hogs' your time. You just don't walk up
and do one simple thing,'' he said of the plane, which broke
technological ground during World War II as the first pressurized
bomber with electronic, remote-controlled guns.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulin</ENAMEX>'s love for B-29s took him to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenland</ENAMEX> to help rescue the
``Keebird,'' which had crash-landed on an arctic lake shore in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1947</TIMEX>. The mission ended in disaster <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> when the partially
restored craft caught fire on takeoff. Human tragedy was averted
only when <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulin</ENAMEX> managed to free the trapped pilot and push him from
the blazing plane, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Agather</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Blue Max</ENAMEX> cafe just beyond the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CAF</ENAMEX> headquarters at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>'s airport, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulin</ENAMEX> tries to explain the allure of the last of
the type of plane that dropped atomic bombs on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Don't you ever think you are the only one in the world doing
something? When you sit down at the controls of Fifi, you are the
only one in the world doing this,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dulin</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   His wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlene</ENAMEX>, lets him indulge his ``loving obsession,''
which ties together his ragtag group. ``It's a type of bonding  &MD;  a
really neat situation,'' she said.
<p>
   There's sometimes misunderstanding, even in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midland</ENAMEX>, where she
teaches ninth grade. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlene Dulin</ENAMEX> said she assumes that some
colleagues view the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Confederate Air Force</ENAMEX> members as an
anachronistic bunch of hawks, perpetrating hatred for a former
enemy. But they're wrong, she said.
<p>
   ``In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1940s</TIMEX>, there was a need in our country for ideas,
manpower and ingenuity,'' she said. ``And this is what the plane
represents. It's not a war machine, a killing machine. It's a
project, more of an idea, to uphold. It sounds grandiose, but
that's what they're carrying on. They won't say it themselves
because it might be taken as too highfalutin.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">CAMP LEJEUNE</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Fourteen Marines were killed and two
seriously injured <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in the fiery <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">pre-dawn</TIMEX> collision of two
helicopters during a huge <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-British training exercise, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The helicopters, a CH-46 Sea Knight troop transport and an AH-1
Cobra attack aircraft, collided in flight about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 a.m.</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine
Corps</ENAMEX> Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rick Long</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the exercises. All the
personnel on board were Americans, he said.
<p>
   Identities of the victims were not released by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">early Friday
evening</TIMEX>. The bodies recovered so far were badly burned, a military
official told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX>, and dental records will be
needed for positive identification of the dead.
<p>
   It was not immediately clear what caused the crash in nearly
impassable terrain near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Courthouse Bay</ENAMEX> boat basin at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camp
Lejeune</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Cobra's mission was to fly ahead of the larger Sea Knight
and secure a landing zone for it. Once the Sea Knight approached
the zone on a planned route, the Cobra was to swing back around.
<p>
   ``We had half a moon <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>. Visibility was good,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camp Lejeune</ENAMEX> spokesman Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Little</ENAMEX>. Winds were reported as
light.
<p>
   Recovery operations got under way almost immediately but were
hampered by darkness and difficult terrain. ``Darkness hampered the
effort quite a bit,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Little</ENAMEX> said. ``The thickness of the brush and
the trees and the swamp compounded the effort.''
<p>
   Forestry crews were called to the densely wooded area to provide
access to the crash site.
<p>
   It was unclear for hours after the crash how many people had
died. At one point, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> put the death toll at 16, but
later an official at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> headquarters at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> said
the confirmed toll was 14.
<p>
   The two injured Marines were the pilot and co-pilot of the Sea
Knight. They were taken to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Camp Lejeune</ENAMEX> hospital, and the pilot
was later transferred to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pitt County Memorial Hospital</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greenville</ENAMEX>, which has a critical care unit, for treatment of head
and chest injuries.
<p>
   Both aircraft were from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marine Corps Air Station New River</ENAMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jacksonville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, officials said.
<p>
   The aircraft were participating in Operation Purple Star, war
games involving more than 53,000 British and American troops massed
off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> coast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The operation continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> after a temporary suspension of
flight activity.
<p>
   Before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s accident, nine <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine</ENAMEX> aircraft had been involved
in crashes <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>. Five crew members died in those crashes.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Marine Corps</ENAMEX> called a two-day halt to all
nonessential flight operations  &MD;  both airplanes and helicopters  &MD; 
to review safety rules after the rash of unexplained crashes.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines</ENAMEX> has led the unexpected growth in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990s</TIMEX> of
low-cost airlines, a role that has earned it widespread praise from
consumers, investors and the federal government.
<p>
   But after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>,
killing 109 people, such praise will inevitably give way to
questions not only about the airline. Airline industry experts
predicted on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that the same ingredients that have made
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> so financially successful are likely to loom as a concern
among travelers, at least for a while.
<p>
   Questions are also likely to arise about the workload of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> as it tries to oversee a rapidly
expanding industry.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that it planned to deploy dozens of
inspectors over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next 30 days</TIMEX> to scrutinize more closely
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s operation and the maintenance companies that work on its
aircraft.
<p>
   ``We want to reassure ourselves and the public that we are doing
all that we can to insure that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> is operating at the highest
level of safety,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX>, associate administrator
for regulation and certification for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>. In television
interviews on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> said
that he considered <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> safe and that he had been a passenger on
some of its flights.
<p>
   While the airline's safety procedures have come under scrutiny,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s financial success is not in doubt. Many new airlines are
trying to copy its noteworthy feat of setting low fares while
maintaining unusually high profit margins.
<p>
   That success is due in large part to tight control on costs, and
no cost is too small to be scrutinized. When the airline started
out, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s president, insisted employees turn in
an empty pen to get a new one, for example. And the top executives,
including <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, sit behind <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100</NUMEX> desks from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Office Depot</ENAMEX> that they
assembled themselves.
<p>
   Rather than investing in new jet aircraft, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> bought used
DC-9 aircraft for approximately <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million to $5 million</NUMEX> each, a
fraction of the cost of a new jet. That gave it a fleet of 51
aircraft that is one of the industry's oldest, many of them
approaching 30 years of age. Yet aviation safety experts generally
agree that if a plane is properly maintained, it can fly for
decades.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> aircraft have suffered several mishaps before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this
weekend</TIMEX>'s crash. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> internal memo from <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> that was described
in The Cleveland Plain Dealer said the agency had found a
``significant decrease in the experience level of new pilots being
hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as well as other positions, such as mechanics and
dispatchers.''
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> spokesman said many <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> concerns had been addressed
with training programs and airline policies.
<p>
   Historically, an airline's second accident rather than its first
has raised widespread doubts among the traveling public. A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
plane had an engine fire that burst into the passenger cabin <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
year</TIMEX> on a runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``Travelers are going to be very suspicious,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve
Lewins</ENAMEX>, an airline industry analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregg Kenyon</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> spokesman, said he was not aware of any
drop-off in passenger traffic on the airline on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>. Shares in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, a publicly traded company, closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$17.875</NUMEX>, down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">25
cents</NUMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The more intense scrutiny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> will most likely reflect
back on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> in coming months. Because of the rise of new
airlines and passenger traffic, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> faces an expanding workload
and its officials acknowledge that their resources have not kept
pace with the growth of the industry.
<p>
   The turnover in the industry has been high  &MD;  about 100 airlines
have filed for bankruptcy since the industry was deregulated in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, some more than once. And since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>, about 50 new airlines
have applied for certification, a pace that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation
Department</ENAMEX> said is accelerating. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> was
a first for any <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airline that started since the industry was
deregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The growth of such carriers represents a sharp turnabout from
fears expressed by government economists around <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">1991</TIMEX> that the
industry would be controlled by just a few enormous airlines.
<p>
   But it is a trend that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, whose mission is in part to
foster the growth of aviation, applauds. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation
Department</ENAMEX> recently announced that low-cost airlines had helped
save consumers <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6.3 billion</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has also been criticized in recent weeks for poor
management of its inspectors, who represent the front line of
safety oversight, including the time-consuming tasks of approving
training and operations manuals for new airlines and enforcing
standards that many aviation safety experts say should be tougher.
<p>
   ``Adherence to the minimum standards is absolutely not enough,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.O. Miller</ENAMEX>, a former head of accident investigations for the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>. ``There isn't a seasoned
airline official I know of who doesn't tell you that.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>, inspector general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>
who oversees investigations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, wrote an essay in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May
20</TIMEX> issue of Newsweek in which she said she has not flown <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
``because of its many mishaps.'' She said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was not
monitoring the industry closely enough, adding, ``I keep seeing the
holes in the safety net  &MD;  gaps in regulation and oversight that can
produce spectacular cases like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   In a telephone interview on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda Daschle</ENAMEX>, deputy
administrator of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, criticized Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>. ``I am
disappointed, to put it mildly, that a high-ranking <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government
official has seemed to conclude that a regulatory shortcoming has
caused this tragic crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daschle</ENAMEX> said. ``We do
not have any information to suggest what caused this accident.''

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 13</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Rogers</ENAMEX> swore loyalty to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX> and its low fares <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> fund-raising consultant woke at the crack of
dawn to drive to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> after canceling his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flight.
<p>
   Too many people like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Rogers</ENAMEX> could spell trouble for the
three-year-old airline after the crash of a 25-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
plane in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> killed all 109 aboard.
<p>
   ``If they lose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 to 15 percent</NUMEX> of their traffic ... they are
heavily in the red,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boyd</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation
Systems Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> shares plunged as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">34
percent</NUMEX>, amid investor concerns that its rapid growth will stall if
consumers decide the airline is unsafe.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> shares fell 4 1/8, or <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">24 percent</NUMEX>, to 13 3/4 in late
trading of 21.1 million shares, making it the most active <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
stock. Earlier, the stock fell to a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">52-week</TIMEX> low of 11 3/4.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> bonds tumbled, too, falling <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">17 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">83 cents</NUMEX> on
the dollar, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Duff &AMP; Phelps</ENAMEX>. The bonds -- <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$150 million</NUMEX>
of five-year notes sold <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> -- are under review for a
possible rating downgrade, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Standard &AMP; Poor's</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said it will step up a
special review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, examining its training, maintenance and
putting supervisors inside <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> cockpits.
<p>
   The initial <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> examination began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
plane skidded off an icy runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>. Before that, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
had more than a half-dozen other safety incidents. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> documents
suggest the incidents may have been the result of inexperienced
pilots and inadequate maintenance.
<p>
   The no-frills, low-cost airline was one of the most successful
start-ups in aviation history, buying and leasing older jets from
other carriers and touting fares as low as <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$29</NUMEX> on its hot <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Southeast
U.S.</ENAMEX> routes.
<p>
   Now, customers may think twice about flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Julia
Waite</ENAMEX>, director of operations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Maupin Travel</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Raleigh</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North
Carolina</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``I think they are going to lose some because of the crash,''
she said.
<p>
   For <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, the margin of error is slim. The company makes
money by filling its planes, enticing consumers -- many of whom
previously took the bus or drove -- with low fares.
<p>
   ``People are going to say: `My life is worth more than the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" MIN="$10">$10
bucks</NUMEX> I'll save on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>,''' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Eric Todd</ENAMEX>, an analyst at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Conseco Capital Management</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carmel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The concern that passengers may forsake <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> prompted
investors to sell shares.
<p>
   ``My belief is this will hurt their traffic for a little
while,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Oberweis</ENAMEX>, head of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Oberweis Asset Management</ENAMEX>.
``We're feeling a little uncomfortable.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oberweis</ENAMEX> said his firm is selling as much as half of the 198,000
shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> it owns.
<p>
   Others said the crash isn't likely to deter to customers.
<p>
   ``People faced with the choice of paying <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$89</NUMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$350</NUMEX>
on another carrier are going to take their chances and get on that
plane,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arnold Barnett</ENAMEX>, a professor of statistics at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Typically, crashes do little to long-term results. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September
1994</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir Group Inc.</ENAMEX> jet crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>, killing all
132 on board and capping a series of fatal air disasters. At the
time, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> traded at about 6. In following weeks, the shares
dropped to about 4. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, the stock closed at 17 and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
the company posted its first profit since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President and Co-founder <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX> defended the
airline's safety standards and use of older aircraft.
<p>
   ``We cannot put too much emphasis on safety,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> said on
CNN <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   From a statistical standpoint, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s crash is surprising,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">MIT</ENAMEX> professor. A typical airline has a fatal
crash every 6 million or 7 million miles, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX> said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s
aircraft have only flown a few hundred thousand miles in its
three-year existence.
<p>
   ``This crash is surprising because it came so early in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s
lifetime,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Barnett</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines Co.</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based low-frills carrier to
which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is often compared, has flown more than 5 million
miles in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">two decades</TIMEX> without a fatal accident, indicating that
low-cost carriers aren't necessarily riskier than their
full-service competitors.
<p>
   Analysts point out that safety is sometimes compromised when
management is preoccupied with growth, a hallmark of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s
meteoric rise.
<p>
   From its start in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1993</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> bought 18 old DC-9s
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines Inc.</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has expanded to 51 planes and
320 daily flights to 31 cities. The company expanded outside the
Southeast and flies to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> canceled service to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montreal</ENAMEX> because it was losing money.
<p>
   As the company expanded, its stock took flight: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> sold
shares to the public in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1994</TIMEX> at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3.13</NUMEX> each, adjusting for
splits, and peaked at 34 3/4 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The wisdom of all that rapid growth is getting a second look
from investors and regulators.
<p>
   ``The further you grow the more stress and strain on your
airline,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Boyd</ENAMEX> said. ``Expansion is what kills airlines.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Even as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> tragedy spurred a new review
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the nation's top airline safety official defended his
agency's past inspections of the low-cost carrier.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has behaved in an exemplary manner in investigating
and looking over <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>, the agency
administrator.
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said he would be meeting with his boss,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX>, after President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
directed federal officials to find whether additional measures
should be taken to ensure that the nation's airlines ``continue to
operate at the highest level of safety.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> is charged with regulating and inspecting commercial
aircraft and certifying their pilots. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also sets safety
standards and checks to make sure the airlines are meeting them.
<p>
   After an accident occurs, however, the independent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>) comes in to investigate the
probable cause and to recommend how to improve transportation
safety.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has come under scrutiny recently as critics questioned
whether it could adequately oversee a changing and growing
industry. Since deregulation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1979</TIMEX>, dozens of airlines have gone
out of business and dozens more have come into existence.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said in a telephone press conference <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
performs inspections of every airline every day  &MD;  more than 1,000
safety inspections daily. He said the agency has been reinforcing
its safety team.
<p>
   ``We have been authorized in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last three years</TIMEX> to add over 1,100
new inspectors. We added 300 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'94</TIMEX>, 200 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">'95</TIMEX>, and we're trying
to hire between 300 and 400 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
and president have both accepted our interest in having additional
help as the industry grows.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McCurry</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration is seeking even more inspectors.
<p>
   ``We have requested in our <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">FY 1987</TIMEX> budget 150 additional
inspectors,'' he said. ``And one of the things that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> will look at specifically is whether
there is some way we can accelerate funding to bring those
additional inspectors on line.''
<p>
   However, the inspector general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>
has warned that she sees ``holes in the safety net  &MD;  gaps in
regulation and oversight that can produce spectacular cases like
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   The criticism came in an essay written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Fackler Schiavo</ENAMEX>
in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 20</TIMEX> issue of Newsweek. In her <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>
role, she said, ``we have found serious deficiencies in airline
inspections, parts and training and in the air traffic control
system. We recently discovered that rather than checking very
aircraft, many inspectors simply examine whatever plane happens by
when they are on duty. One plane was inspected 200 times in one
year; others not at all.''
<p>
   Indeed, just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two weeks ago</TIMEX>, a former aircraft inspector told a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> subcommittee that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was lax in its searches for
potential safety hazards. The witness testified from behind a
screen hiding his identity.
<p>
   ``The wings could be falling off,'' but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> ``is more
concerned about paperwork,'' he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee</ENAMEX>'s oversight subcommittee.
<p>
   According to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Scripps-Howard Newspapers</ENAMEX> report, the former
inspector said, if he found a problem that ``was extremely serious
and you couldn't sleep over it,'' he would report it. Otherwise,
``you'd let it slide.''
<p>
   However, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> defended the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspections of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>. He
pointed out this was the first fatal crash involving any <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
airline started up <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">since the industry was deregulated</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Immediately after <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> moved in to find out why it happened.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> is composed of five members nominated for
five-year terms by the president and confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>. One
of these members usually accompanies the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> ``go team'' to
accident sites. The ``go teams'' are composed of investigators and
specialists who are experts in the various transportation fields  &MD; 
aviation crash experts for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> probe, for example.
<p>
   Once the probable cause of an accident is determined, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>
issues safety recommendations on how to prevent a recurrence.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> has directed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> to respond to
these safety recommendations <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">within 90 days</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> also issues a final report on the accident after
completing an investigation that can last up to a year.
<p>
   In addition to civil aviation crashes, the independent board
looks into some highway, railroad, marine and pipeline accidents.

<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> LIKELY TO LOOK FOR EVIDENCE OF ELECTRICAL FIRE; NEW AGENCY RULE
WARNED OF COCKPIT SMOKE

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Investigators looking into the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s
crash of a DC-9 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Valujet</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> are likely to look into
the possibility of an electrical fire caused by chafed wire in an
overhead control panel.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last month</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> issued a final
order requiring a wiring bundle on all 816 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>-registered
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> DC-9s, MD-90s, and C-9 (military) aircraft to be
re-wrapped and rerouted to ``prevent the potential for a . . . fire
and uncontrolled smoke throughout the cockpit.''
<p>
   In the order, published in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">April 15th</TIMEX> Federal Register, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> noted: ``Although there have been no reported cases of damage
to the wire bundle on any in-service Model DC-9 series airplane,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has received reports of chafing found on the wire bundle.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> concluded that ``the potential for damage still exists
when the wire bundle is improperly routed in the overhead switch
panel of the cockpit such that chafing occurs.''
<p>
   The order, which has been in the making since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, is
scheduled to take effect <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said the wires should be re-wrapped as a
precautionary measure, it determined that the wrapping ``would not
necessarily enhance safety, and would cause (airlines) to incur an
unnecessary expense.'' As a result, the agency said the carriers
would not be required to re-wrap the wires until they rerouted them
in the cockpit or observed evidence of chafing during routine
inspections.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> estimated the cost of re-wrapping the wires would be
about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$220</NUMEX> and the work would take about three and a half hours for
each plane.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Dorr</ENAMEX> said he could not comment on whether
chafing of the cockpit wires might have caused the smoke reported
in the cockpit of the 27-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Valujet</ENAMEX> minutes
before it crashed, shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International
Airport</ENAMEX>, killing all 109 people aboard.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Kolbenschlag</ENAMEX> (CQ), owner of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kolbenschlag Aviation
Services</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Falls City</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oregon</ENAMEX>, an accident investigation
researcher for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">16 years</TIMEX> and a licensed airframe and power plant
mechanic, said chafing ``could cause an electrical fire.''
<p>
   The extent of the fire could depend on what other material was
available to fuel the fire and the extent of current carried by the
wires, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kolbenschlag</ENAMEX> said. He noted that insulation in the control
panel would burn with ``fairly dense, black smoke.''
<p>
   ``Obviously, if the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> feels concerned enough about it to put
out (a rule) . . . it's certainly something that they have on the
list to look at,'' he said.
<p>
   The aircraft involved in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash is listed on 27
``service difficulty reports'' filed over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past eight years</TIMEX> with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, according to an analysis by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Institute for
Computer Assisted Reporting</ENAMEX>. In addition, at least 10 other SDR
reports were filed prior to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, according to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NICAR</ENAMEX> officials.
<p>
   Among the 27 reports, the aircraft returned to the closest
airport 10 times.
<p>
   The most serious incident involving this plane occurred on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb.
24, 1981</TIMEX>  &MD;  when the plane was owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Airlines</ENAMEX>  &MD;  when it
suddenly lost cabin pressure and made an emergency descent over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vincennes</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   Of the dozen reported problems since the plane joined the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> fleet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>, 10 were listed as severity level 1  &MD; 
the least severe  &MD;  one was listed as a 2, meaning accidents from
that problem were ``uncommon,'' and one was listed as a 5, the
severest rating frequently linked to an accident.
<p>
   That report was filed after the landing gear failed a latch
check and unsafe lights were on when the gear was retracted.
<p>
   The DC-9 that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> was last inspected <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five days
earlier</TIMEX>, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Roland Herwig</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> spokesman in the agency's
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> records center.
<p>
   That inspection was an ``A'' level inspection, the most cursory.
The aircraft received a slightly more in-depth ``B'' inspection on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 19</TIMEX>, and an even more intensive ``C'' level inspection on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 30, 1995</TIMEX>. It also received another inspection on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 10 of
this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records did not indicate where the inspections were made or
who conducted them. Inspections are usually performed by the
airline or an independent contractor.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Herwig</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> did not have any information available about
the engines on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane.

<p>
   Their wives and husbands, parents and children are gone.
<p>
   But for the families and friends of those killed when a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
DC-9 plummeted into a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> swamp <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, waiting for some
trace of their loved ones prolongs their grief and delays their
healing, therapists and counselors say.
<p>
   ``This is, I think, probably the worst scenario'' for those left
behind, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peggy Bohme</ENAMEX>, who counsels grieving children as
director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Warm Place</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   As divers in rubber suits poked the muck with sticks searching
for remnants of what had been <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592, friends and
families of those who had been on the plane struggled with sorrow
exacerbated by helplessness.
<p>
   Although searchers pulled the plane's flight data recorder and
seven body bags of human remains  &MD;  no parts larger than a knee  &MD; 
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, investigators said it could be
weeks before all the pieces of the plane and its passengers can be
retrieved.
<p>
   Even then, it will be ``difficult, if not impossible,'' to
identify all the victims, predicted retired <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dade County</ENAMEX> Medical
Examiner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Davis</ENAMEX>, who is participating in the effort.
<p>
   ``The waiting does add to the grief. To the stress of grief,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Randy Cochran</ENAMEX>, who has seen first-hand how families handle the
sudden, violent death of a loved one as a therapist with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Project
Heartland</ENAMEX>, a counseling group established in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> after
the bombing there that killed 168 people.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debbie Stearns</ENAMEX> and her husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill</ENAMEX>, are wrestling with whether
to have a memorial service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX> for their daughter, flight
attendant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jennifer Stearns</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Farmer's Branch</ENAMEX>, or wait for the
possibility that her body will be recovered.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kimberly Reedy</ENAMEX>, whose 52-year-old stepfather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Hazen</ENAMEX>,
co-piloted the aircraft, said their family is considering a
memorial service, but isn't certain what to do. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Reedy</ENAMEX> said her
mother left the couple's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mineola</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, home <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> and went to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. ``She is there for the recovery of the body. But they have
pretty much given up on that, I believe,'' she said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hazen</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stearns</ENAMEX> were among the 109 people killed when the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">ValuJet</ENAMEX> nose-dived into a swamp about eight minutes after taking
off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami International Airport</ENAMEX> on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The plane was scheduled to head next to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas/Fort Worth
Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Until family and friends of the crew and all the other victims
have tangible proof that a loved one is gone, they may cling to
hopes even they realize are unfounded, therapists said.
<p>
   ``You have to know that person no longer lives. You have to be
able to touch or see them. It's extremely important to say
goodbye,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohme</ENAMEX> said. ``The mind is saying it's true, but the
heart is saying it's not.''
<p>
   The wait can take a toll financially as well, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>
attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Howie</ENAMEX>, who has represented victims and families in
several airline disasters.
<p>
   Though their lives have been turned upside down, victims'
families still have bills to pay.
<p>
   And if the person killed was the principal breadwinner, a long
delay in finding a body can cause difficulties. Life insurance
policies traditionally require a death certificate before benefits
can be paid, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howie</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``In cases like this, it could be weeks or months until a
certificate is issued. But there usually are ways around that when
death is obvious,'' the attorney said.
<p>
   ``In this case, nobody has their affairs in order.''
<p>
   When bodies are shattered, as they apparently were in this
crash, families face a difficult choice of whether to view remains.
<p>
   ``We've known families who were denied that because the body was
not intact and they've always resented that,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bohme</ENAMEX> said. ``For
some, even seeing a foot or hand, for someone in this situation,
can help. They can say, `Yes, that was my husband.' But this has to
be handled very carefully, very gently.''
<p>
   Throughout the ordeal, the families need the support and
understanding of friends and co-workers, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patrick O'Malley</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX> therapist who specializes in grief counseling.
<p>
   ``Our culture, I think, is very under-ritualized about grief.
So-called less civilized nations have a number of rituals. We
pretty well rush it,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Malley</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``We've got <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">three days</TIMEX> between death and the funeral and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">a week</TIMEX>
of casseroles and that's about it.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Debbie Stearns</ENAMEX> and her husband visited with a counselor
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, although she said the family is still numb from the
tragedy.
<p>
   Her house is filled with well-wishers and relatives now, which
is one reason she would like to have a memorial <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this week</TIMEX>.
<p>
   She already is dreading the day when pain replaces the numbness.
``It really hasn't sunk in yet,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stearns</ENAMEX> said. ``Once everything
settles down, it's going to be very hard.''

<TEXT>
<p>
   So when is an airplane too old?
<p>
   Some of the nation's biggest airlines fly planes that are more
than 25 years old. And the military operates B-52 aircraft that are
more than 40 years old, flown by pilots who are younger than the
planes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines</ENAMEX>, whose DC-9 jet crashed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>,
killing 109 people on board, operates a fleet of DC-9 jets whose
average age is about 26 years, making its fleet the oldest for any
large airline in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But aviation safety experts said that a plane's age, in and of
itself, does not necessarily make it any less safe than a younger
plane. Just as with cars, other important considerations are how
well a jet has been maintained and how many times it changed
owners.
<p>
   The 27-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane that crashed had only one previous
owner, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX>, the nation's third largest airline. ``If
you are going to buy something used, that's a pretty good
pedigree,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stamey</ENAMEX>, vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avitas</ENAMEX>, an
aviation consulting firm that appraises and inspects aircraft.
<p>
   The age of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s DC-9 fleet is not unusual among major
airlines that use the planes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World
Airlines</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> all operate dozens of DC-9s with an average age
of 24 to 26 years.
<p>
   Many of those aircraft will be much older by the time they are
retired. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines</ENAMEX>, for example, plans to invest <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$6
million</NUMEX> per plane to upgrade more than 100 of its DC-9s to comply
with federal noise regulations and keep them flying beyond the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year
2000</TIMEX>.
<p>
   There are many reasons why airlines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX> are deciding
to extend the life of many planes in their fleets rather than buy
new ones. New aircraft cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" STATUS="OPT">tens of millions of dollars</NUMEX>, and many
airlines have decided it is more economical to refurbish their old
planes than buy new ones, even though older aircraft face more
rigorous, and therefore more costly, requirements for maintenance
and replacing parts. Many fledgling airlines, in fact, have fleets
that are much younger, on average, than some of the more
established carriers.
<p>
   Many regulations intended to guard specifically against the
effects of aging were put into place after an accident involving an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aloha Airlines</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737, when the passenger cabin ripped open in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> because of corrosion and metal fatigue, sweeping a flight
attendant to her death.
<p>
   After the industry was deregulated in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX>, many airlines
started expanding rapidly and ordered new aircraft. And in the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX>, airlines generally believed that growth would lead to
financial success.
<p>
   But in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early 1990s</TIMEX>, the airlines lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" STATUS="OPT">billions of dollars</NUMEX>,
in part because of traffic declines and rising fuel costs as a
result of the war in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX>. Since then, airlines have
focused more on reducing overhead costs, weighing decisions to buy
new aircraft more carefully than ever before.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   To maintain low costs, many start-up airlines like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> have
not only bought used aircraft but also paid companies that do heavy

Aeronautical University</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, said he was troubled by
the trend.
<p>
   ``For the airline, it is cheaper,'' he said. ``But the people
that you've got working on airplanes for maintenance subcontractors
don't have the same level of motivation and feeling of ownership

maintenance work for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> had been forced to return
to airports seven times in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last two years</TIMEX> for a variety of
safety problems, including a faulty heat exchanger, a loss of oil
because of a loose oil cap and a malfunctioning hydraulic pump. It
also made an emergency landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Memphis</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX> when the plane
lost cabin pressure.
<p>
   It also received an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> maintenance inspection <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Tuesday</TIMEX>, in
which inspectors checked, among other things, fluids and tire
treads and other major equipment for signs of fatigue or cracks.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> records show that before the crash <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had 12
minor problems or more serious accidents since it started flying in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, including an inoperative microphone that rendered the pilots
unable to communicate with air traffic controllers and a fire in an
engine on a runway in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that injured several people
on board.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">THE EVERGLADES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A flight data recorder pulled from the
muddy swampland where Flight 592 crashed is in good condition and
could yield important clues about the cause of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s disaster,
federal officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Although the so-called ``black box'' carried by the aging
ValuJet measures 11 types of information about the flight  &MD; 
compared with the 75 monitored by more modern equipment  &MD; 
investigators believe the data recorder will help explain why smoke
was reported in the cockpit and cabin of the DC-9 before it
nosedived into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, taking the lives of all 109 on
board.
<p>
   ``Our folks worked on it <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">overnight</TIMEX> and there is good data on the
recorder,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   As local divers continued the grim search for body remains, they
also helped federal aviation investigators search for the plane's
second black box  &MD;  a cockpit voice recorder that could provide
additional information about the crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said the missing box may still be difficult to locate.
Just because both recorders were in the plane's tail section, they
may not be near each other in the wreckage because of the
tremendous impact.
<p>
   ``We have (found) a large number of major parts from the tail of
the aircraft, where the recorders are located, that are fairly far
from where we found the flight data recorder,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   While speaking with reporters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> also acknowledged that
investigators are confining their search for aircraft parts to the
perimeter of the crash site, because they still have not settled on
a plan for retrieving major portions of the aircraft from its
swampy location, more than 300 yards from the nearest road.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Later in the day</TIMEX>, local and federal officials from a wide array
of civilian and military agencies including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>
met in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> to figure out how to recover the wreckage, which
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said ``remains the big challenge for us.'' The main
fuselage is in a crater about 130 feet by 40 feet and of an
undetermined depth.
<p>
   Investigators have said the swamp, which sucked the airliner
into its murky depths and left only small traces of the plane on
its surface, is the most difficult site ever encountered for
recovering a large passenger plane.
<p>
   Options for retrieval include constructing a large floating work
station or a circular dam to allow drainage of the area around the
wreckage.
<p>
   Alternatives also include constructing a new road to the site or
erecting temporary bridges from the nearest solid ground in order
to minimize pollution of the ecologically fragile swamplands.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the challenges posed to divers searching for remains
of the victims increased.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Glen Kay</ENAMEX>, on-site commander for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Dade Police
Department</ENAMEX>'s homicide unit, said decomposition of the remains of
victims was already taking palce, due to heat in the 80s, mud and
swamp water.
<p>
   To recover the victims' remains  &MD;  and perhaps find the ValuJet's
cockpit voice recorder  &MD;  divers moved in coordinated lines across
quadrants in a grid, marked off with bright orange flags.
<p>
   The divers also continued to work through gruelling conditions,
donning airtight protective gear, in addition to rubber suits and
masks, in the heat to protect themselves from fuel oil and other
contaminants.
<p>
   ``It's a very trying experience,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kay</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At an airport hotel in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, about 65 family members continued
their vigil. Authorities explained the search and planned to show
the families photos of the crash site, which many relatives want to
visit. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> is considering their requests.
<p>
   The wife of a victim of the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103 over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, also addressed the families.
<p>
   ``In this case, the anguish is how could an airplane full of
people disappear? It's unfathomable,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victoria Cummock</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Coral Gables</ENAMEX>. ``It's so hard to conceptualize that the whole plane
and their family members are gone.''
<p>
   Her husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John</ENAMEX>, was among the 270 people killed in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>
terrorist bombing.

ESTABLISHED AIRLINES SAFER, SOME OFFICIALS SAY
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)

c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Boston Globe</ENAMEX>

<p>
   Despite assurances from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico
Pena</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and other
low-cost carriers are safe enough, several aviation officials said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that there is a difference in the degree of safety between
start-up airlines and established ones.
<p>
   Both types of carriers meet federal requirements, but major
airlines spend <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY" STATUS="OPT">millions of dollars</NUMEX> training their well-paid pilots
so operations are standardized, and carefully track the maintenance
of airplanes. Start-up airlines often pay their workers less and
farm out training and some airplane maintenance.
<p>
   ``If a government official says'' low-cost carriers ``are safe,
then the flying public thinks `it must be true.' But it is
absolutely false,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nance</ENAMEX>, an aviation analyst and pilot.
<p>
   ``The risk you take getting on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, any major carrier, is infinitesimal compared to upstart
carriers, which have created a system that replicates many of the
risks that we have learned to get rid of by taking lessons paid for
in blood.''
<p>
   A federal accident investigator agreed that the major airlines
have programs in place to enhance safety that go well beyond the
threshold set by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> requirements, while the fledgling carriers
sometimes simply meet the requirements.
<p>
   ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> talks about safety in the context of their regulations
and they set the lowest common denominator in areas you choose,
pilot performance, maintenance performance, record keeping,'' said
a high-ranking federal accident investigator who spoke on condition
the remarks not be attributed. ``All the major carriers operate
high above the minimum standard.''
<p>
   Until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>'s crash, no start-up airline that began
operations in the wake of airline deregulation in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1978</TIMEX> &UR;  &LR; had ever
had a fatal crash. In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">past decade</TIMEX>, all such crashes involved
established carriers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   However, aviation officials said that safety needs to be
measured on a much broader scale than just fatal accidents. The
opportunity for mishap is a major factor. Also, the number of
flights by fledgling carriers is so much smaller than that of major
airlines that statistical comparison is even more difficult, they
said. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, for instance, has 40 planes, but <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> has 577.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane that crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>,
killing all 109 on board, was one of more than a dozen DC-9s that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> purchased from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s fleet shows that at least three other
DC-9s had more service difficulties than the ill-fated 27-year-old
plane. The average age of planes in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> fleet is 26.4
years, the average on some established airlines is 9.2 years on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, 11.5 on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> and 11.6 on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The plane that crashed had 12 service-difficulty reports in two
years with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, including having to return to the airport eight
times because of mechanical problems ranging from low oil pressure
to a stairway light coming on and the crew being unable to hold
altitude.
<p>
   While comparative service figures were not readily available,
some aviation officials were surprised to learn that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had
brought 43 enforcement actions against <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> since it started
operations with two old DC-9s in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1993</TIMEX>. The actions,
including written warnings, letters of correction and fines, mostly
highlighted flaws in the airline's maintenance, flight operations
and record-keeping programs.
<p>
   ``Given how many they have had in such a short period of time
and the size of their fleet, that is pretty heavy,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Geoff
Collins</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the 400,000 member <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">International Airlines
Passenger Association</ENAMEX>. ``But they obviously took corrective action,
or the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> would have grounded them.''
<p>
   ``There is a reason why these low-cost carriers charge what they
charge,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Collins</ENAMEX>. ``There is a great deal of difference once
you are up in the air who you are up in the air with.''
<p>
   Some former employees also question the reliability of some
fledgling carriers compared with larger carriers.
<p>
   ``Every day there was a mechanical problem,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda
Picardi</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> gate agent. ``If it wasn't planes coming
in late to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>, it was one of our planes going out late. And the
biggest thing they cared about was trying to maintain the 20-minute
turnaround time. No one said, `Send it out anyways,' but there were
always delays.''
<p>
   A former maintenance manager for a charter airline who now works
for a major carrier said the difference can be striking.
<p>
   He said the established airlines have mechanics who track
planes, spot problems quickly and send out systemwide alerts, while
maintenance that is outsourced, such as with many low-fare
carriers, does not have the same ability to quickly lead to
potential areas of trouble.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX>, who is also a paid consultant to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX>, said that if
pilot training, for instance, is conducted by someone other than
the carrier, ``There is no way you can rise to the level of
standardization that the majors have. ... A <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$39</NUMEX> ticket does not pay
for the level of safety that the American public expects.''
<p>
   Federal, state and industry sources point to an incident that
one federal official said was indicative of sloppy operations.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 was taken out of service at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan International
Airport</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March</TIMEX> and was ferried to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> for maintenance.
Sometime, when planes are empty, ballast  &MD;  usually extra fuel or
bags of sand in baggage compartments  &MD;  is needed to maintain the
appropriate center of gravity of an empty plane.
<p>
   Five sources said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> employees threw a used automotive
transmission in the baggage hold as ballast. It was neither on a
pallet, nor tied down, they said. When the plane took off, the
transmission started sliding around and by the time the aircraft
landed, the transmission had gone through a bulkhead, the sources
added.
<p>
   Officials from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> had no immediate comment. It appears the
alleged incident was not reported to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, because there is no
service-difficulty report on file at its facility in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Emergency crews responded to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> alerts at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX> 18
times in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>, but only one apparently was reported to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> by the airline on a service-difficulty report, even though 10
of the incidents involved mechanical problems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials could not explain why they had no record of the
incidents. ``All the people who could answer questions about
service difficulties and maintenance are all tied up,'' said
spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Les Dorr</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In two of the 10 instances, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> pilot requested <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX>
emergency assistance, sources said. In the first one, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 8</TIMEX>, a
plane had to return because of a problem with the nose landing
gear. The other occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 27</TIMEX>, when the plane had to return to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> because the landing gear doors would not retract.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> reports do indicate that in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX> two flights from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>
had landing gear light problems as they approached their
destinations in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>.

<TEXT>
<p>
   One of the most disturbing flights I ever took was on a
perfectly safe plane.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> L-1011 was flying in a fierce <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX> thunderstorm on
approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>. Suddenly, the pilot came on the
loudspeaker, his voice cracking. ``There's been an ...'' and then
there was a long pause.
<p>
   No one in the plane said a word.
<p>
   Then the pilot finally said. ``There's been an incident'' ahead
of us.
<p>
   After being diverted partway to another airport, we circled back
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>. As we descended, we could see the wreckage of a plane
sticking out of the ground in the distance.
<p>
   We taxied to a gate next to the one where the other plane had
been scheduled to park. As we filed into the terminal, there were
dozens of crying people who had just heard the news: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> Flight
191 had crashed, killing 137 people.
<p>
   We had been flying directly behind it on the same type of
aircraft and on the same airline.
<p>
   The terrible <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> is a powerful
and tragic reminder of what can go wrong any time, on any plane. My
job is helping to police the country's skies, and the more I learn,
the more troubled I become.
<p>
   I got interested in aviation very early on. I took my first
flight at the age ot 10, in a six-seater flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>,
and I got my pilot's license when I was 18.
<p>
   Yet I keep seeing the holes in the safety net  &MD;  gaps in
regulation and oversight that can produce spectacular cases such as
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash.
<p>
   My job at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department ot Transportation</ENAMEX> is to investigate
problems and fix them  &MD;  a great position for a former prosecutor
with a passion for planes. In more than five years, we have found
serious deficiencies in airline inspections, in parts and training,
and in the air-traffic-control system.
<p>
   We recently discovered that, rather than checking every
aircraft, many inspectors simply examine whatever plane happens by
when they are on duty. One plane was inspected 200 times in one
year, others not at all.
<p>
   That was not as shocking as an incident <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>, when
we convicted a New Age guru of fraud  &MD;  after he received <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.4
million</NUMEX> from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to give management courses. Among other
things, his cult believes in UFOs.
<p>
   The truth is that, like many Americans who are reading more and
more about failing air-traffic systems, near misses and disasters
such as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and the unsolved 737 crashes in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colo.</ENAMEX>, I don't like to fly.
<p>
   But I do. I am, however, a very careful consumer. I go out of my
way to stay off commuter planes. I have skipped conferences because
I would not fly on marginal airlines  &MD;  and because of its many
mishaps I also avoided flying on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In recent years, small commuter planes have been more than twice
as likely to be involved in an accident as the major carriers, and
until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">this year</TIMEX> the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> allowed them to operate under significantly
less stringent safety standards.
<p>
   Weather is also a major factor. If there is a thunderstorm with
high winds  &MD;  if I see a mass of red on the Weather Channel radar
scope  &MD;  I simply take a later flight. If you look at the crash
statistics, bad weather is a major problem.
<p>
   I do not simply want to spread doom and gloom. I have great
faith in the major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers. They have a terrific safety
record. They have risen above the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s shortcomings.
<p>
   When <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOT</ENAMEX> wanted to crack down on the use of bogus plane parts,
for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers stepped up long before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>  &MD; 
which is part of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX>  &MD;  would. Airlines backed us in
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>, even when the legislation cost them money. They figured
out that safety sells.
<p>
   Still, flying can be nerve-racking. One especially unlucky
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">summer</TIMEX> day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">several years ago</TIMEX>, I was going from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco</ENAMEX>. From my seat, I noticed mechanics trying to reattach a
piece of the plane's metal skin with duct tape.
<p>
   I pushed the flight attendant's button and said I would like to
get off the plane. They would not let me, but other passengers
spoke up, too. Hours later, the airline took the plane out of
service.
<p>
   Fortunately, flying days like that are not the norm. But they  &MD; 
like the disturbing images of debris in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>  &MD;  are reason
enough to worry.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 15</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX> was not
authorized to carry a load of 50 to 60 oxygen generators suspected
of causing the deadly crash of the discount airline's Flight 592,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Spare oxygen generators in the cargo hold of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 are
suspected of contributing to a fire that preceded the crash of the
plane in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Saturday</TIMEX>, killing all 110 persons
aboard.
<p>
   Though oxygen generators are standard equipment on aircraft,
they are classified as hazardous materials when carried as cargo,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials said.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is not an authorized `hazmat' carrier,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al
Roberts</ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Neidl</ENAMEX>, airline analyst with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Furman Selz</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>,
said the unauthorized cargo is not a serious enough deficiency in
itself to threaten the airline's future. ``I'm not excusing them
for breaking the rules. This is a breach,'' he said. ``But it's
only going to result in a fine and more bad publicity. This isn't
going to ground the airline.''
<p>
   In trading <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> shares fell 11/16 to close at 14 5/16.
Shares had fallen as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, the first
trading session after the crash, to 11 3/4.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, which is directing the
accident investigation, said an on-board explosion involving the
oxygen generators could have triggered a sudden loss of speed and
altitude.
<p>
   ``We are paying a lot of attention'' to the oxygen devices in
the plane's cargo hold, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> vice chairman, said at
a briefing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The generators, which had exceeded their shelf life, were being
shipped to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, according to news
reports. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said recovery crews had yet to locate any of the
devices in the water and mud.
<p>
   A flight recorder recovered by police divers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> indicated
the DC-9 had a flight ``anomaly'' 3 1/2 minutes before the crash.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said two parts of the plane were discovered,
marked with ``apparent soot,'' and that suggested ``there could
have been an explosion,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Nearly every plane has oxygen generators on board. The
containers are used in airline cabins to supply passengers with
oxygen for approximately 15 minutes. They are designed to be
installed in an overhead passenger service unit or in aircraft seat
backs.
<p>
   Oxygen generators are designed to produce oxygen when a
passenger tugs on the oxygen hose that drops down after an airplane
loses cabin pressure. The chemical reaction that produces the
oxygen also generates heat, and in normal use, the generators are
well insulated to prevent surrounding material from catching fire.
<p>
   A damaged oxygen generator could allow heat to escape, while
producing oxygen that could feed a fire. ``This doesn't mean it
will start a fire,'' one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official said, ``but it will support
combustion.''
<p>
   ``What the hell were they doing'' in the plane's cargo hold,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Boyd</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Systems Research</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Golden</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado</ENAMEX>, said of the oxygen devices. ``I can't understand why all
that stuff was in the front of the airplane.''
<p>
   An oxygen generator was cited as the cause of a fire on an
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX> DC-10 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>. No one was hurt in the
accident, but the plane, which was being repaired, was destroyed.
<p>
   One <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official said he knew of another accident involving an
oxygen generator that self-ignited. That accident did not occur on
a plane.
<p>
   Airlines that are discovered to be carrying hazardous materials
as cargo without authorization are subject to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> penalties ranging
from warning letters to fines of up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25,000</NUMEX> per violation.
<p>
   Separately, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> announced it had temporarily
suspended <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> from carrying <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military personnel following
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last weekend</TIMEX>'s crash.
<p>
   ``For up to 30 days, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> official business
travelers will not be booked on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael
Doubleday</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>'s deputy spokesman.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doubleday</ENAMEX> said the decision was based on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s ``relatively
high number of accidents and incidents in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past two years</TIMEX>.''
<p>
   During that time, the airline's planes have encountered five
accidents and 11 less serious mechanical problems that disrupted
flights.
<p>
   Earlier, the government said it was expanding its examination of
the discount carrier, building on a 120-day inquiry that began in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> chief <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX> said the agency still considers
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> ``safe to fly.''
<p>
   ``The additional inspections we are doing are additional safety
margins and should be viewed as such,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said at a news
conference. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Yesterday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said it would hire 100 additional
inspectors to increase the monitoring of all the nation's airlines.
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> case, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tony Broderick</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s associate
administrator for regulation and certification, said the review
would involve ``five specific additional steps'' in which the
agency would:
<p>
   -- Review all reports of mechanical problems filed within the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past 12 months</TIMEX> to insure they have been corrected.
<p>
   -- Inspect all aircraft the morning after they have undergone
overnight repairs.
<p>
   -- Put <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors on every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane for weekly
in-flight inspections. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> has ``at least 350 flights weekly
and we'd like them on as many as possible,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> said of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors.
<p>
   -- Reinspect all of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s maintenance stations at operations
centers away from the airline's main repair facilities.
<p>
   -- Conduct ``top to bottom inspections'' of every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> plane
that has undergone heavy maintenance.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> will also take additional voluntary safety
measures to ensure that safety standards are being met. These
include hiring a new airline ``safety czar,'' who will report
directly to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>, and a review of all
mechanical irregularities, air returns and pilot reports to
establish, by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, a schedule to inspect every <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 crashed as the pilot and first officer were
attempting an emergency landing of the 27-year-old, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell
Douglas</ENAMEX>-built DC-9 jetliner back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> after reporting smoke in
the cockpit and passenger cabin.
<p>
   The airline has one of the oldest jet fleets in the sky, and has
drawn criticism from the inspector general of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation
Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>. However, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> has
defended the airline's safety standards, saying: ``We cannot put
too much emphasis on safety -- ever.''

<p>
   Even as federal officials said they would expand their oversight
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Airlines</ENAMEX>, more troubling information about the low-cost
carrier emerged <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The airline was not authorized by the federal government to
carry hazardous materials  &MD;  including oxygen-generating canisters  &MD; 
as cargo, senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> officials said
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The DC-9 that crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, killing all
110 on board, had as many as 60 such canisters in a cargo hold, and
accident investigators suspect they may have released oxygen that
accelerated a fire on the plane. The official death toll was raised
to 110 after an infant not listed on the initial flight manifest
was added.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials announced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that they were widening their
safety review of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> planes. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors plan to board each
company plane at least once a week for in-flight safety checks.
<p>
   A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Globe</ENAMEX> review of enforcement action taken by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> against
the airline found that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> was fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,000</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX> for not
notifying authorities about an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX> incident where an
aircraft component failed and smoke or fumes entered the cockpit.
<p>
   And a review of 284 service difficulty reports of the airline's
aging DC-9 fleet found smoke was reported in the aircraft 16 times
for various reasons, ranging from malfunctioning coffee makers to
short circuits in the autopilot. In all, smoke was reported in the
cockpit seven times, and nine times in the cabin. &UR; 
<p>
    &LR; The cockpit crew of Flight 592 reported smoke in the cockpit
and cabin as the plane climbed through 10,000 feet shortly after
taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s hub in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. The
27-year-old DC-9 was trying to return to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> when it went into a
steep dive, slamming into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> at more than 350 miles per
hour.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Globe</ENAMEX> review also found that the airline was fined <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,500</NUMEX>
for operating an aircraft that was not in an airworthy condition
because not all of the necessary equipment was functioning. That
enforcement action, which was closed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>, stemmed from an <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct.
20, 1994</TIMEX>, incident.
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official said fines of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,500</NUMEX> and <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3,000</NUMEX> are not
necessarily excessive, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has fined airlines as much as
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750,000</NUMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> had at least 43 charges of violations of federal
aviation regulations brought against it since starting operations.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> officials did not return telephone calls for comment.
<p>
   A federal accident investigator said the oxygen generators,
stainless steel canisters, contained two chemicals that when mixed
generate enough heat to ignite nearby paper or rags and can be fed
by pure oxygen. The canisters, carefully position in airplanes, are
used to produce oxygen in case of an emergency. Pulling down on the
cord of an oxygen mask releases a hammer that starts the chemical
reaction.
<p>
   But the canisters on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 were in a cardboard box
in a baggage hold on an airplane that also contained three airplane
tires and wheels that investigators believe contained grease.
<p>
   ``Nothing that you would want to put together were placed in
that baggage hold, all the elements were there,'' said one <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>
investigator.

   The storm around the outspoken <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> was spawned by her harsh
and public criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and her frank admission that she
avoids flying on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Wyden</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ore.</ENAMEX>, called it ``troubling'' when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOT</ENAMEX>
inspector general doesn't ``feel comfortable flying an airline that
is out flying planes and offering its services to the American
public.''
<p>
   Inspectors general are appointed for indefinite terms and report
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president. They usually stay out of the public
eye as they investigate incompetence, waste and other abuses within
federal agencies.
<p>
   A former assistant <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> attorney, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> was appointed to
her present post in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>. Born in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pioneer</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1955</TIMEX>, she took
her first flight at the age of 10 in a six-seat plane. She received
her private pilot's license at the age of 18 while as a student at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ohio State University</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Although she had been critical of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> at congressional
hearings and in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> reports, it was only in
the aftermath of the fatal crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 that the
nation began to pay heed. She wrote an essay in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">May 20th</TIMEX> issue
of Newsweek charging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has ``serious deficiencies in airline
inspections'' and revealing her own fears about flying on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
She has since expressed her concerns during television appearances.
<p>
   Her remarks have been criticized by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>
and others in the aviation community. They point out that the cause
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash has not even been determined.
<p>
   ``I personally found her behavior quite irresponsible,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Strong</ENAMEX>, author of ``Why Airplanes Crash,'' and a business
professor at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">College of William and Mary</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``That's a very serious thing to go public with,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>.
Before taking her charges to the news media, he said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>
should have reported them to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX> was flying over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> hours after
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 disappeared into the sawgrass and slime.
   ``It is very, very tough to figure out how we're going to get
the aircraft out from that swamp,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>) and the top federal
investigator into the cause of the airline tragedy.
   In a way, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> was thrust into this high-profile assignment
by luck of the draw. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> is composed of five members nominated
to five year terms by the president and confirmed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>.
One member is always on duty for emergencies and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> went
down during <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>' watch.
   However, in another sense, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> had prepared for much of his
life to lead the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> ``Go Team'' of aviation crash experts on this
tough trip to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Florida</ENAMEX>.
   Before President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> nominated him to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Safety Board</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> was based in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX>'s senior representative in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Western Europe</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern Africa</ENAMEX>. He represented the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> on issues of aviation
safety with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and foreign airlines, aircraft manufacturers and
government agencies. Previously, he headed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA Southern Region
Policy, Plans and International Office</ENAMEX> and held other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
positions.
   An active pilot with commercial certification, he is a member of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Wings Club</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AeroClub</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Royal Aeronautical Society</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">England</ENAMEX>.
   As the top federal investigator on the scene, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> is charged
with finding the ``probable cause'' of the crash, formulating
safety recommendations to prevent future such accidents and
preparing an extensive report on the accident.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> airlines had been beset by safety problems in the
weeks before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> crash and that in investigating
those problems the agency had discovered deep flaws in its own
monitoring of the airline.
<p>
   While maintaining that the airline is safe and that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
acted appropriately as it learned more of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s flaws, the
agency released internal reports <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> managers
were concerned about their ability to monitor the airline.
<p>
   ``Some critical surveillance activities did not receive much
attention,'' said a report by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flight Standards Office</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 14 of this year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The agency's increased scrutiny of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> since Flight 592
crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, killing all 110 people
aboard, prompted the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based carrier to cancel half its daily
flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> officials said that the company's 51 planes
would remain in service but that it would cut its daily flights to
160, from about 320.
<p>
   ``The measures we are announcing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> go well beyond the
current <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspection to reassure our customers that we share
their insistence on the utmost safety,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s
president, said in a statement.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February</TIMEX>, which was made after a string of
problems with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> planes prompted the agency to take a closer
look, found problems with the regulated and the regulator. Despite
the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s fleet consisted almost entirely of old
airplanes, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> made no structural inspections of the planes for
two years, according to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 14</TIMEX> report, which said that this
area had been ``severely overlooked.''
<p>
   Inspections of the airline's manuals and procedures were also
neglected, as were inspections of things like mechanical shops, the
report said. Inspecting manuals is important to assure that they
are appropriate; for example, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> found, at one point <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
was training DC-9 crews with manuals meant for other airplanes.
<p>
   The report said that the airline lacked ``adequate policies and
procedures for the maintenance personnel to follow,'' and also
lacked data on engine trends. It recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> consider
``recertification of this airline.''
<p>
   Explaining that term <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony J. Broderick</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s Associate Administrator for Regulation and Certification,
said it meant determining, step-by-step, that the airline was in
compliance, a process that he said was under way.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> also said that the job of checking on the performance
of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s pilots in the cockpit would be taken over directly by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspectors, beginning <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX>. These proficiency checks are
usually carried out by the airline, using employees who have been
qualified for that job by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At a news conference that became testy at times, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Broderick</ENAMEX> was
asked repeatedly why his agency never simply grounded <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>,
after a variety of incidents in which aircraft were damaged,
sometimes with minor injuries. He said that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s problems
never demonstrated ``systemic safety violations.''
<p>
   ``In large airlines and large companies, you will find
individual pockets of noncompliance,'' he said. But he added, ``We
judge people in a binary fashion: either you do meet our standards
or you don't.'' And <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, he said, does.
<p>
   ``If they do not meet the standards at any time in the future,
we will not let them fly,'' he said.
<p>
   But he also sought to demonstrate, by reciting a chronology of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s problems and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s responses, that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had been,
at every step, appropriately concerned and active.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Among the steps taken was the preparation of a second report, by
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> inspectors' office, that found an increased number of
unfavorable reports on maintenance and ``a significant decrease in
experience level of new pilots being hired by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as well as
other positions such as mechanics, dispatchers, etc.''
<p>
   It also found ``continuous changes of key management
personnel.''
<p>
   And there was a third report, a statistical analysis of the rate
of accidents of low-cost carriers per 100,000 departures, compared
with the rate for major, higher-cost carriers. A draft of that
third report, dated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2</TIMEX>, was obtained by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Chicago Tribune</ENAMEX>,
which published an article based on it on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Later that day</TIMEX>,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> released what it said was a final version of that report
and asserted that, contrary to the assessment of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">The Tribune</ENAMEX>, the
figures did not show major differences between the two groups of
airlines.
<p>
   But that study did cast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> in an unfavorable light.
<p>
   The report said that for each 100,000 departures, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had
2.537 serious accidents (all accidents, minus those resulting from
turbulence, other ``minor accidents in flight'' and mishaps at the
gate or on the ramp). In comparison, 12 low-cost airlines had zero:
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AmeriJet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air South</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Carnival</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Frontier</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kiwi</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Morris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reno</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Spirit</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Vanguard</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Western Pacific</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>. Only
one other low-cost airline studied had had a serious accident,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Tower</ENAMEX>, with a rate of 8.680.
<p>
   Among nine major carriers, which are far larger and thus less
likely to achieve a rate of zero, the average rate was 0.76. The
data went back to <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Also, of any of the 23 airlines studied, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had the
second-highest level of pilot deviations  &MD;  cases in which a pilot
strayed too far from an assigned altitude or route through the sky
 &MD;  and the highest rate of runway incursions, or cases in which a
plane was on the wrong spot on the ground.
<p>
   In a statement written as a preface to the report and released
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said that ``because of the significantly
smaller volumes of departures by low-cost carriers, a single
accident could lower an airline from the best record in the survey
to the worst.''
<p>
   The figures for low-cost airlines are also distorted by the
relative sizes of the companies. Measured by flights, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest
Airlines</ENAMEX> accounts for <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of the group's business, and it
had no serious accidents and a low rate of minor accidents.
<p>
   For all 14 low-cost carriers, including <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX>, the total
accident rate was .418 per 100,000 departures, vs. .300 for the
``higher cost'' companies, which were <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">America West</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Continental</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The rate of serious accidents was .12 for the low-cost carriers
and .08 for the major airlines. That means that a low-cost airline
was <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50 percent</NUMEX> more likely to have a serious accident than a major
airline. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said that the report had found ``little
difference'' in relevant statistics.
<p>
   The difference was far larger if <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> was excluded from the
low-cost group; the other low-cost carriers had an accident rate of
1.204 per 100,000 departures, four times the rate of the major
carriers.
<p>
   The report did find that the low-cost carriers did better than
the major airlines in one measure of safety, pilot deviations. For
the low-cost carriers the rate was 1.86; for the majors it was
2.66.

<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 26, 1994</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines</ENAMEX> discovered a leaking
hydraulic line on one of its DC-9 jets. Federal rules required
immediate repair of the leak, but the airline waited. The line,
part of a system that retracts the front landing gear, was replaced
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">23 days later</TIMEX>, after 148 flights.
<p>
   The violation was one of many found by a team of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> inspectors in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX>, according to
internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> documents. The agency also found that the airline had
failed to fully report an incident of smoke in the cockpit from a
blown switch and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> had not kept records when pilots
performed poorly. For these and other problems, the aviation agency
fined the airline <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$8,500</NUMEX>.
<p>
   The agency would continue to find safety lapses at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>
during several closer looks over the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next year and a half</TIMEX>,
according to internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> documents.
<p>
   The documents, in addition to records of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of
Defense</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX>, draw a portrait of a
rapidly growing airline that was found again and again to have
shortcomings in safety matters in such areas as record keeping,
maintenance, training and cockpit discipline.
<p>
   The documents also support the contention by the aviation agency
that it noticed the problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and stepped up its scrutiny
of the airline. However, none of the agency's measures were
effective in halting the lapses, suggesting that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> was often
two steps behind.
<p>
   Yet there is no evidence that the safety problems described in
the records had anything to do with the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>. Investigators said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> that a partly
burned aircraft tire carried as cargo was a likely source of smoke,
possibly ignited by an activated oxygen generator, that the
co-pilot reported just before the crash.
<p>
   The crash has given rise to persistent questions and accusations
about the safety record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and the agency's oversight of
the airline. Those questions continued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> on several <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>
news programs. Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>, said on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="NBC">NBC News</ENAMEX>
program ``Meet the Press'' that he had serious concerns about
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s safety and that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX>
had ``gone too far'' by repeatedly saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was safe to
fly.
<p>
   Although the cause of the crash is still unknown, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> and
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> took steps <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> to restore public confidence in the
airline, which had grown to 320 daily flights and 51 aircraft in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">two and a half years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, said in an interview that he
was not interested in discussing the shortcomings described in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> documents, problems that he said had been fixed.
<p>
   ``It is clear we have not had a perfect safety record,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>
said. ``But we are taking extraordinary steps to insure the highest
level of safety.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials said that their actions were appropriate and that
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s problems never demonstrated ``systemic safety
violations.''
<p>
   ``The system is doing what it should,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Broderick</ENAMEX>,
the associate administrator of regulation and certification. ``We
were pushing them in the right direction.''
<p>
   After the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> team inspection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> that found that the
airline had delayed repairing the hydraulic line, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was found
on several occasions to need more pushing.
<p>
   An engine fire in a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that was about to take off from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last June</TIMEX> provides another example. The accident sent
shrapnel into the plane's cabin and started a fire, badly burning a
flight attendant.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> traced the failure to a
crack in the engine caused by corrosion that had been overlooked
during maintenance work <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four years earlier</TIMEX>. The engine was on one
of nine planes that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> acquired from a Turkish airline. The
safety board said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> did not have records for each engine
component. After the accident, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>, telling it
to develop safeguards to insure that it does not again acquire
``questionable assets.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last August</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> evaluated <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> as a
possible contractor. A department report said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was turned
down for many reasons. It had no adequate review of maintenance
documents, had no internal audit program, and had incomplete and
disorganized training records of maintenance workers, the report
said.
<p>
   A <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">month later</TIMEX>, the aviation agency stepped up its oversight of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> for 11 days. The agency found that the airline did not have
an internal auditing program for safety matters like maintenance.
The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also found that on the main passenger doors on two planes,
the switch that automatically turns on the doors' caution lights
was taped over to keep them extinguished.

<p>
   Pieces of an oxygen generator were found <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> embedded in a
spare tire being carried as freight on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> Flight 592,
providing strong evidence that a fire or explosion in the forward
cargo hold caused the plane to crash.
<p>
   Investigators also found first evidence of fire in the passenger
cabin.
<p>
   The revelation about the oxygen generators by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> investigators came just four days after
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s president, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewis Jordan</ENAMEX>, said a document prepared by a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> contractor showed the canisters, which were being carried
as freight, were empty.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is not authorized to carry hazardous materials such as
the chemicals stored in the full generators, which provide oxygen
to emergency masks, as freight. The canisters can heat up to 430
degrees and, when installed in a plane, must be covered with
special insulation.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> investigator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Feith</ENAMEX> said Flight 592 carried 136 of the
oxygen-generating canisters as cargo, more than double the amount
previously believed. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>'s discoveries raise serious questions
about whether the canisters were, in fact, empty.
<p>
   Among the items found embedded in the spare tire, investigators
said, were end caps from a canister, a firing mechanism and pieces
of a wrecked canister. The tire also showed signs of burning.
<p>
   The crew of Flight 592 reported smoke in the cockpit shortly
before the DC-9 plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, killing all
110 aboard. Among the debris analyzed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> was a 6-inch piece of
railing used for anchoring passenger seats that had heavy sooting
patterns.
<p>
   In addition, analysis of the tire and pieces of two canisters
indicate fire was present in the forward cargo hold. The canisters,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said, also showed signs of trauma.
<p>
   ``They did show evidence of stress in that they were bent and
twisted,'' he said. ``To what extent they distributed or caused it,
there's no way to tell at this time.''
<p>
   The canisters originally were removed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two or three months ago</TIMEX>
from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> MD-80 aircraft because they had exceeded their
recommended life span. &UR;  &LR; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Washington Post</ENAMEX> reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>'s
editions that a clerk for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre Tech</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> contractor, listed
the canisters as ``empty'' on a shipping manifest. Because the
clerk saw green tags indicating they had been taken out of service,
``in his mind, he believed they may have been empty,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth
P. Quinn</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre Tech</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Quinn</ENAMEX>, however, emphasized that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre Tech</ENAMEX> returned the
canisters to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and had no way of knowing they would be put on
a plane. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, he told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Post</ENAMEX>, ``made the decision to put them
on the plane.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Sabre Tech</ENAMEX> are already in a legal battle over who is
responsible.
<p>
   Even after the expiration date, full canisters contain hazardous
chemicals that, when activated by pin triggers, heat up and produce
oxygen.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX>, in an interview on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, acknowledged he could not
be sure the canisters were empty, but pleaded with travelers to
wait until the end of the federal investigation before drawing any
conclusions about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s safety.
<p>
   ``We need a little help in stopping the rush to judgment,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Meanwhile, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> came under new
criticism <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> for failing to respond aggressively enough to a
study prepared <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX> showing that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> had an
accident rate 14 times higher than major carriers even before the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> crash.
<p>
   A low-cost airline started in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flies the oldest
fleet in the industry and has been under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> scrutiny over its
maintenance practices.
<p>
   ``I've gone over that report, and I have to tell you the safety
record of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> does bring into mind several key questions,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> Majority Whip <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>, Republican of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mississippi</ENAMEX>,
who is a leading candidate to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s top
leadership position.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lott</ENAMEX>, who is on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX>'s aviation subcommittee, said on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC</ENAMEX>'s ``Meet The Press'' that he worries the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> erred in not
putting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> under more stringent review after learning of its
comparatively high accident rate.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX>, however, defended the agency and
said he believes <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> is a safe choice for passengers.
<p>
   He said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> moved quickly to investigate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> after the
earlier incidents, and extracted promises from the company to
upgrade maintenance procedures and slow its rate of growth.
<p>
   ``We don't know what caused this accident,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> said. ``I'm
satisfied the airline is safe and our people are doing a good
job.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jordan</ENAMEX> emphasized that no previous accident involving
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> had caused a fatality, and many of them were comparatively
minor. He has called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s safety record good and promised to
cooperate with the federal government fully in determining the
cause of the crash of Flight 592.
<p>
   The government is continuing its plane-by-plane safety review of
the airline.
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>, where recovery workers are still trying to
locate the cockpit voice recorder, crews prepared to use
ground-penetrating radar to map out the crash site and pinpoint
wreckage buried under the muck.
<p>
   The search will focus on the canisters and the voice recorder
that may contain the pilots' final minutes of conversation, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX>
said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> vice chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX> said on CNN that ``there are
lots of other things that can cause fires on airplanes,'' but that
oxygen generators are ``high on the list in terms of what we are
interested in finding and looking'' at.
<p>
   Search crews also hope to find a circuit-breaker panel located
behind the captain's seat. Problems with that panel delayed the
plane's <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>-bound flight out of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier on the day of the
crash</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The experimental low-level radar, which has been used to locate
buried dinosaur bones and Egyptian tombs, has already located
several objects buried in the muck, including part of a wing.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said an independent contractor would be hired by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">week's
end</TIMEX> to bring up the larger parts. During the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">weekend</TIMEX> more of the
crew's possessions, parts of the tail section, insulation, ceiling
material and a metal chair track that showed evidence of soot
damage were recovered.
<p>
   Workers have so far recovered less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of the craft.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 22</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX>'s senior management
said the company has stabilized following the crash of one of its
planes but probably won't return to its pre-crash schedule until at
least <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The no-frills airline said it may have to cut more flights and
won't resume the suspended ones for at least several weeks. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
may delay delivery of new jetliners as well.
<p>
   ``We have stabilized our situation,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Priddy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
chairman and co-founder, said in a conference call with investors.
``We can emerge from this terrible accident as a safe, strong and
profitable airline.''
<p>
   Executives didn't answer questions about the full financial
impact of the crash, analysts said.
<p>
   ``I still wouldn't recommend that our clients buy the stock,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX> analyst <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lewins</ENAMEX>. He said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> implied
that it will post a loss for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">quarter</TIMEX> but withheld many details.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priddy</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> may take a charge against <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX>
earnings. He didn't elaborate.
<p>
   Shares of the low-fare airline fell 1/8 to 13 in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> trading
of 2.74 million. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s share price has dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">27 percent</NUMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 10</TIMEX>, the day before Flight 592 crashed in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida
Everglades</ENAMEX>, killing all 110 aboard.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> had <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$254 million</NUMEX> in cash at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of April</TIMEX>, providing
it with ``considerable staying power,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priddy</ENAMEX> said. The company
declined to specify how much cash it has used in reducing its
flight schedule and beefing up maintenance checks.
<p>
   Calls from customers booking flights have declined, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
said, but demand hasn't dried up or been ``significantly
impacted.''
<p>
   The company has refunded <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.1 million</NUMEX> to customers in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">past
week</TIMEX>. Passenger traffic dropped <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">5 percent</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, as the airline
flew <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">80 percent</NUMEX> of its scheduled flights, carrying three-quarters
of the customers who had bought tickets.
<p>
   Its <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$750 million</NUMEX> of liability insurance should be adequate to
cover costs tied to the crash, including replacing the 27-year-old
DC-9 that was destroyed, the airline said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, which owns all 51 planes in its fleet, said it will
consider leasing aircraft in the future. The company had planned to
boost its fleet to 54 by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year-end</TIMEX>, but now it may stall delivery of
some planes.
<p>
   ``That indicates that capacity growth may be slowed,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Harris</ENAMEX>, an analyst at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Lehman Brothers</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> halved the number of its daily flights to 160
from 320 to ensure that it has enough planes to fly its routes.
<p>
   ``A two-for-one flight margin seems reasonable right now,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priddy</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The company's available seat miles, a benchmark that measures
airline capacity by the number of seats available for paying
customer, has been reduced by at least <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> said it expects its intense aircraft inspection program
to help restore public confidence and satisfy <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> regulators.
<p>
   ``There is no airline in the country that can guarantee they
won't be shut down the next day by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Priddy</ENAMEX> said.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Following the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> is beginning a public and probably prolonged inquiry into
the cause of the accident, the regulatory environment and airline
safety in general.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House Transportation Committee</ENAMEX> plans to hold wide-ranging
hearings in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late June</TIMEX> on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash and its ramifications.
The hearings will examine the safety records and practices of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> and its contractors as well as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> actions regarding the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based carrier.
<p>
   With a chance to cast doubts on the competency of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration, Republicans are already questioning whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
was lax in inspecting <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   There is criticism that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX> did not tell a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate</ENAMEX> committee about an internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report showing that low-cost
carriers such as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> have a higher accident rate than major
airlines.
<p>
   ``I'm very much concerned about the testimony that we received
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> administrator, Mr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX>, because he didn't even make
reference to that <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 2nd</TIMEX> report,'' said Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Trent Lott</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miss.</ENAMEX>,
the leading contender to replace <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Dole</ENAMEX> as majority leader.
<p>
   ``I'm worried about the fact that they did not as aggressively
pursue problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> as they should have,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lott</ENAMEX> said on
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NBC-TV</ENAMEX>'s ``Meet the Press.''
<p>
   Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Pressler</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">S.D.</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Committee on
Commerce, Science and Transportation</ENAMEX>, has written <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> to find
out about the administrator's ``disturbing'' testimony.
<p>
   In the letter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pressler</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> indicated that, except for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash, a case could be made that low-cost carriers had
a better safety record than major airlines. The internal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> report
``seems to contradict your response,'' wrote <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pressler</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In another letter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pressler</ENAMEX> asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> why the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had not
implemented a recommendation by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety
Board</ENAMEX> calling for installation of fire and smoke detection systems
in cargo compartments.
<p>
   However, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> may have a Republican ally in Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Stevens</ENAMEX>
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX>. Chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Senate Governmental Affairs Committee</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> has expressed concern about <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary
Schiavo</ENAMEX>'s harsh and public criticism of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and her frank
admission that she avoids flying on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> has begun a review of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>'s record to see if she
expressed the same level of concern about low-cost and commuter
carriers in her official reports as she did in a Newsweek essay and
in television appearances. Earlier, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> charged that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> is
``destroying confidence'' in airline travel and suggested that
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> consider firing her.
<p>
   Inspectors general are appointed for indefinite terms and report
to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX> and the president. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>' committee has oversight
over inspectors general, said his spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mitch Rose</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> also has a parochial concern in closely
examining <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX>'s charges because ``about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX> of the
flights'' in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alaska</ENAMEX> are on commuter airlines. With <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> saying
low-cost and commuter carriers are safe and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Schiavo</ENAMEX> saying they're
not, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rose</ENAMEX> said, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> wants to find out who is right and ``why
they're saying different things.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash has also renewed the debate over whether the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> should be made into an independent agency rather than part of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> is responsible for setting aviation safety standards and
making sure that airlines comply with them. But the agency also
promotes the industry it regulates. As part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>
administration's push to increase exports, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX> has joined
commercial missions overseas to help sell the American-made
aircraft his agency also watches over.
<p>
   ``There is an inherent conflict in those two missions,'' said
Sen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William S. Cohen</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> Republican, at a committee hearing
on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>.

COCKPIT VOICE RECORDER IS RECOVERED AT CRASH SITE
(th)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MIREYA NAVARRO</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>
</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MIAMI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Police searchers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> found the cockpit voice recorder
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May
11</TIMEX>, providing investigators with the second of the ``black boxes''
that often yield crucial information on the cause of a crash.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> said the
recorder arrived in the agency's laboratories in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> for analysis. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for the
safety board, said searchers from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Metro-Dade Police Department</ENAMEX>
using sticks as probes retrieved the recorder from an area they had
searched and to which they had returned for a second look.
<p>
   Safety board officials also said they had found evidence that
the fire that occurred before the crash had spread into the
passenger cabin.
<p>
   The cockpit voice recorder captures the conversation between the
pilot and the co-pilot in a flight's <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last half-hour</TIMEX>, as well as
mechanical sounds on board. Investigators had made its recovery a
priority because in other crashes this recorder, when combined with
the other black box  &MD;  the flight data recorder  &MD;  has provided
conclusive evidence about the events that led to an accident.
<p>
   The flight data recorder of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s Flight 592 was recovered
shortly after the accident, and investigators learned from it that
the plane's instruments reported a sudden decline in altitude and
air speed, which the air control radar on the ground did not see.
That, investigators said, suggested an explosion on board that
raised the pressure inside the cabin and skewed the instruments.
<p>
   The cockpit voice recorder could help solve the puzzle if, for
instance, it captured the sound of an explosion or crew members
saying some controls were not responding or that smoke obscured
their vision. There were gaps in the data recorder's tape, however,
and it is known how much cockpit sound was recorded.
<p>
   Flight 592 crashed into the muck and sawgrass of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>
about 20 miles west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> as it turned back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami
International Airport</ENAMEX> minutes after takeoff. All 110 people aboard
were killed.
<p>
   The crew had told air traffic controllers that there was smoke
in the cockpit and the cabin, and until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> investigators had
been relying on an air traffic control tape to pick up background
sounds and other clues.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   So far, with about <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">40 percent</NUMEX> of the wreckage recovered, the
leading theory is that oxygen generators carried in the forward
cargo hold activated and generated enough heat to ignite tires or
other materials that were also carried as cargo, causing the fire
that occurred before the plane went down.
<p>
   At a briefing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gregory Feith</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> investigator in
charge of the crash, said that debris recovered from the site in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">the last few days</TIMEX> included a seat frame with melted aluminum,
evidence that the fire reached to the passenger cabin, although
investigators have not traced the exact location of the seat. He
said there was evidence of a ``heavy, dense smoke in the cabin''
that moved up the plane's walls, which also had fire damage.
<p>
   But investigators are still trying to pin down how the fire
ignited and spread and to determine its effects. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said they
have reconstructed the front part of the fuselage to figure out the
``smoke pattern''  &MD;  the smoke's path into the cabin and the effect
of both fire and smoke on flight controls, the electronics of the
aircraft and the work of the crew. He said that the flight control
cables ``do not exhibit actual fire or burn-through.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said investigators would probably try to re-create what
happened in a mock-up of the front of the plane by igniting oxygen
generators and seeing how long it takes for the smoke to move
through the model. ``We don't know if we'll ever be able to
determine what the passengers went through in that cabin,'' he
said.
<p>
   One problem for investigators has been what <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> called ``the
randomness'' of the wreckage, with parts of the plane scattered
over a 600-foot area. The medical examiner's office has been able
to identify remains from only eight victims.
<p>
   Although arduous, the search has produced enough fragments to
cover the floor of a 15,000-square-foot hangar at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kendall-Tamiami
Airport</ENAMEX>, where clumps of wire and twisted metal with red tags have
been laid out in structural order  &MD;  first debris from the plane's
nose, then wings, then tail.
<p>
   Some pieces, like engines and tires, are big enough to be
recognizable but others can fit in a fist. The pieces include two
oxygen canisters whose deformation indicate exposure to high heat,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Feith</ENAMEX> said, and a bracket from an overhead baggage compartment
covered with soot.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOSTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">Two harrowing hours after its crew lost much of its
ability to navigate while at 35,000 feet over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Atlantic</ENAMEX>,</TIMEX> a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767 jet with 205 people aboard blew its tires during a
spectacular emergency landing at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan International Airport</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   No one was injured, though emergency crews were prepared for a
disaster as the crippled jet approached at high speed with its crew
powerless to control flaps that allow a plane to land safely at
slow speeds.
<p>
   Airport emergency crews scrambled out to the runway and
air-traffic controllers coaxed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair Holland</ENAMEX> jet down
through tense moments after the pilot had what he later described
as ``a cockpit blackout.''
<p>
   The plane, enroute from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Orlando</ENAMEX>, touched down at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2:21 p.m.</TIMEX> and smoke and fire belched from the overheated brakes on
its main landing gear, as it rolled to a stop on a taxiway.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> fire rescue crews sprayed water on the gear and passengers
and crew members sat calmly on board while airstairs were brought
to the plane. Passengers were then bused to the international
terminal.
<p>
   Aviation officials praised the cockpit crew for bringing the jet
safely to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> from its cruising altitude of more than
six-and-a-half miles high.
<p>
   Unable to determine where he was as he approached the coast of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>, the pilot relied on air-traffic contollers who continually
provided updated information on his location.
<p>
   The pilot chose <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> over other closer airports because it was
a larger facility, which he thought would be better prepared for a
crash, aviation officials said.
<p>
   ``This crew did a great job with the lack of instrumentation, no
auto pilot, no flaps, no spoilers, no thrust reversers,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> aviation director <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Thomas Kinton</ENAMEX>. ``They landed where they
were supposed to land and turned off onto the taxiway they were
supposed to.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said he spoke briefly with a member of the cockpit crew
who told him that while the plane was flying over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gander</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newfoundland</ENAMEX> when the instruments went out.
<p>
   ``It's a scary thing to be flying at 35,000 feet and lose that.
Poof! It's gone,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">Nearly six hours after the landing</TIMEX>, passengers departed <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:05 p.m.</TIMEX> aboard another <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair</ENAMEX> jet.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> officials said the replacement <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair</ENAMEX> jet was en
route from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX>, but was diverted to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. The passengers on their way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New Jersey</ENAMEX> were bused
there from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   While waiting for the replacement airplane, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair</ENAMEX> passengers
and crew at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX> were kept in a restricted area by customs
officials and could not be interviewed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Adminstration</ENAMEX> investigators were to examine the
aircraft, said spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arlene Salac</ENAMEX>. She said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair
Holland</ENAMEX>, is certified to fly large jet aircraft into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">US</ENAMEX> as a
scheduled passenger service.
<p>
   The carrier is the second-largest airline in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Netherlands</ENAMEX>.
Officials in its operations center in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> refused to comment
on the emergency landing.
<p>
   The airline began in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1958</TIMEX> as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martin's Air Charter</ENAMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>, <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">50
percent</NUMEX> of its fleet are convertible aircraft which can be used for
either passengers or freight. The average age of its aircraft is
four years.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> officials said the crew radioed in an emergency while
still off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> and were diverted to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>. The plane
landed on runway 4R, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan</ENAMEX>'s second longest at 10,005 feet.
<p>
   Because the flaps  &MD;  which extend from the wings and produce lift
at lower airspeeds  &MD;  were not working, the plane's speed on landing
was faster than usual.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said the plane landed at about 165 knots, some 35 knots
faster than normal.
<p>
   On touching down, the pilot could not rely on spoilers,
anti-skid devices and reverse thrusters to slow the plane. Instead
he had to use continuous braking to stop the 180-foot-long plane.
<p>
   Because only the brakes were used, they overheated and caught
fire. Fuses in the tires blew them out while the plane was rolling
to a stop.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> officials said firefighters saw the brakes glowing red
hot and doused them with water.
<p>
   With the plane disabled but safe, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massport</ENAMEX> officials decided to
bring airstairs to the plane and bus the passengers to the
international terminal, rather than risk injury in an emergency
evacuation using an inflatable slide.
<p>
   ``The firefighters did what they were supposed to do and the
pilot's performance was excellent,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kinton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair</ENAMEX> sent another plane into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> to transport the
stranded passengers to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Chief customs inspector <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Matt Farrell</ENAMEX> described the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Martinair</ENAMEX>
passengers as calm as they waited for their new aircraft in the
off-limits customs area at the international terminal.

INCIDENTS INVOLVING HAZARDOUS AIR CARGO RISE SEVEN-FOLD
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">SIOBHAN MORRISSEY</ENAMEX>

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="past decade">Over the past decade</TIMEX>, incidents involving hazardous cargo aboard
airplanes have increased nearly seven-fold, federal <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of
Transportation</ENAMEX> records show.
<p>
   There were 120 occurrences in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> and 811 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="that decade">During that
decade</TIMEX>, there were 4,029 incidents and 334 injuries.
<p>
   That growth is prompting some industry analysts and pilots to
call for a ban on hazardous material aboard passenger aircraft. And
as investigators try to determine whether hazardous material
contributed to the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flight 592, the pilot's mother
is asking for a special panel to determine why flight crews are
sometimes unaware of such cargo.
<p>
   The consequences of hazardous material problems can be
disastrous. Among the worst:
<p>
   Baggage handlers in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greensboro</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.C.</ENAMEX>, discovered a fire  &MD;  as
well as an illegal shipment of tear gas, volatile liquid
dichloromethanecq, lamp oil, witch hazel and matches  &MD;  in the cargo
hold of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> DC-9 just after touch down.
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> DC-9 made an emergency landing in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tenn.</ENAMEX>, forcing 126 passengers and crew to evacuate after
chemicals illegally shipped from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Austin</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Texas</ENAMEX>, started a fire in
the cargo hold.
<p>
   Three crewmen aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 707 became disoriented by
fumes from hazardous cargo, causing them to crash and die at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The hazardous cargo aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 that crashed in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, killing 110 people, were 119 oxygen
generators. Heavy insulation renders them harmless when used for
emergency oxygen masks.
<p>
   But when improperly stowed in a cargo hold they can generate
more heat than volcanic steam and have been known to cause at least
one fire that demolished an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Trans Air</ENAMEX> DC-10 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Increased flights and heightened vigilancemay account for the
rise in problems detected with hazardous material, acknowledged
transportation department spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Patricia Klinger</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> hazardous materials coordinator, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jerry Pace</ENAMEX>,
attributes the mushrooming of such incidents aboard airplanes to a
combination of illicit and increased shipments, as well as
increased vigilance.
<p>
   One advocate for increased scrutiny of hazardous materials on
passenger aircraft is <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larry Bell</ENAMEX>. He knew
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Candalyn Kubeck</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flight's pilot, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">for 18 years</TIMEX>. They
took flying lessons at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palomar Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX> and earned
their pilot's licenses within four days of each other.
<p>
   ``Elimination of hazardous material in general is a good idea,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bell</ENAMEX> said. ``The traveling public does not know what is being
carried in the cargo compartments. It's a potential safety problem
that needs to be addressed. If a small amount of hazardous cargo is
approved, what constitutes too much? It's debatable whether it
should be allowed at all.''
<p>
   Industry analyst and former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> inspector <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Hynes</ENAMEX> agrees.
Most hazardous material can be shipped more safely by truck, he
said.
<p>
   ``Unless there's a sense of urgency, why are you even shipping
it by air?'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hynes</ENAMEX> wondered. ``The aggravation to the public by
keeping it off the airplane I don't think will be particularly
great.''
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frank Black</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tim Neale</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Transport Association</ENAMEX>,
a trade association for the major airlines, maintain that outlawing
hazardous materials would only lead to smuggling.
<p>
   ``If tomorrow there is a ban on all these things, people who
need to get something in a hurry are going to put it in a box and
say it's socks when it's whatever,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Neale</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Marilyn Chamberlin</ENAMEX>, pilot <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kubeck</ENAMEX>'s mother, wants to convene a
special panel of airline pilots and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>
officials to explore among other issues ``an industry-wide
weakness'' of failure to notify pilots and crew when hazardous
materials are stowed aboard the aircraft.
<p>
   Knowledge of what's on board and where it is located can help a
pilot make emergency decisions when minutes mean the difference
between a safe landing and disaster, she said.
<p>
   ``If anything comes out of this horrible tragedy, it's tightened
oversight,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX> said. ``Being the type of mother I am, I
can't just say, `Okay, if she's gone, she's gone.' I just can't sit
back.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> devised extensive rules
governing what can be shipped by air, how to package hazardous
cargo, and how to notify the pilot and crew of its existence and
location on board the aircraft. But the rules are only as good as
the people who follow them, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chamberlin</ENAMEX> noted.
<p>
   It's too soon to tell how the transportation department will
come down on the issue. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DOT</ENAMEX> spokeswoman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Klinger</ENAMEX> said department
officials will review comments from the public and industry before
considering such a sweeping change. However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> the
department acted with uncharacteristic swiftness in banning oxygen
generators as cargo aboard passenger planes in the wake of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash. . .

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A Japanese naval destroyer accidentally shot down
an American bomber during joint military exercises in the central
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, forcing the two American crew members to bail out seconds
before the bomber plunged into the ocean. Neither was reported to
have been seriously injured.
<p>
   The American bomber, an A-6E Intruder, was fired upon as it
towed a gunnery target  &MD;  the target in the exercise  &MD;  near the
Japanese destroyer. The incident occurred <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> about
1,600 miles west of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>. The crew members who ejected were
rescued by the Japanese vessel, the Yuugiri.
<p>
   While American and Japanese naval officials insisted that the
incident was an accident, it could still have a political cost to
the Japanese government, both as a reminder that Japanese naval
ships are involved in live-fire exercises in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>, and from
the uncomfortable symbolism of a Japanese attack on an American
plane in the vicinity of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``The Japanese pacifists will have a field day with this,'' said
a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> official. ``They remember <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX> better than we
do.''
<p>
   However, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">early Wednesday</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, no protests had surfaced, and
Japanese experts said there was no reason to believe that the
incident would affect Japanese participation in these joint
exercises.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, defense officials, unhappy with the notion that their
forces could not distinguish between a friendly warplane and a
target towed far behind it, said that the American-made gun was
supposed to be programmed so it could not shoot down the plane, but
that something had gone wrong.
<p>
   It was the second such incident. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last year</TIMEX> during training
exercises, a Japanese fighter plane locked onto another Japanese
fighter, an F-15, and tried to simulate shooting it down for
training. Instead, the plane managed to fire a real missile and
shot down the craft in mid-air.
<p>
   The Japanese government quickly apologized for the latest
incident, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael McCurry</ENAMEX>, said that
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, who received a written report on the accident,
had accepted the ``gracious expression of regret.''
<p>
   Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Department</ENAMEX> said they had not received a
full report from the Japanese on the cause of the accident,
although they speculated that a mechanical problem might explain
why the destroyer's American-made Phalanx weapons system opened
fire on the bomber. The weapon, which can be triggered
automatically, functions like a giant machine gun, firing waves of
metal projectiles at an incoming target.
<p>
   The pilot, Lt. Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Royster</ENAMEX>, 33, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, and the bombardier-navigator, Lt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith A. Douglas</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, 30, were transferred by helicopter from the
Yuugiri to their home ship, the aircraft carrier Independence.
<p>
   Aboard the Independence, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royster</ENAMEX> underwent surgery for facial
lacerations and was reported to be in good condition. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX>
returned to duty almost immediately. ``They're in very good
shape,'' said Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Arterburn</ENAMEX>, a spokesman in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pearl Harbor</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX>. ``We're very, very happy that
no one was seriously injured in the accident.''
<p>
   As a result of the accident, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> agreed
to halt the use of live ammunition by the Yuugiri and surrounding
American ships until an investigation is completed on the cause of
the accident. The ships were participating in a six-nation,
monthlong exercise.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> officials said that the A-6E, an attack bomber, was
dragging the gunnery target with a cable nearly three miles long.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The Phalanx system aboard the ship was manufactured by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General
Dynamics</ENAMEX>, and is capable of firing off nearly 3,000 rounds a
minute. The weapon can be set on a hair trigger, capable of firing
two seconds after a target is detected. It is intended to protect
ships from missile attacks.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1987</TIMEX>, a missile fired accidentally by an Iraqi fighter
jet nearly sank the American guided missile frigate Stark and
killed 37 of its crew members. While the Stark was equipped with
the Phalanx, the weapon was not used to defend the ship. It was
turned off at the time out of fear that a friendly ship might
somehow trigger the weapon to fire.
<p>
   The accident appeared to be an unfortunate chapter in the
history of the A-6Es, the carrier-based bombers that are scheduled
to be retired <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">later this month</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="25 years" STATUS="OPT">after 25 years in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> fleet</TIMEX>.
The planes were used heavily in bombing missions during the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Vietnam</ENAMEX>
War, and in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX>, Intruders were used in a strike on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and Japanese officials <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> called off a mock war in the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> as they scrambled to find out why a Japanese destroyer shot
down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> carrier bomber instead of the aerial target the
aircraft was towing at least 2 miles behind the plane.
<p>
   An A-6E Intruder from the carrier USS Independence was downed by
gunfire from the destroyer Yuugiri during the massive ``RIMPAC
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">`96</TIMEX>'' naval exercise in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>. The exercise involves 44
warships, 250 aircraft and the navies of six nations.
<p>
   Both crewmen of the A-6E safely ejected after the accident and
were picked up by a small boat from the Japanese warship, then
flown by helicopter to the carrier, where they were treated for
minor injuries. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> identified them as pilot Lt. Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William
Royster</ENAMEX>, 33, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kansas City</ENAMEX>., <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, and bombardier-navigator Lt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keith Douglas</ENAMEX>, 30, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ala.</ENAMEX>, both assigned to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT"><ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Medium
Attack Squadron 115</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Carrier Air Wing 5</ENAMEX></ENAMEX> aboard the Independence.
<p>
   Seventeen <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> warships and nine vessels from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Maritime Self Defense Force">Japanese
Maritime Self Defense Force</ENAMEX> ``have suspended all live-fire events
following the accident,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jon Yoshishige</ENAMEX>
announced. ``They will conduct a safety standdown until the
investigation is complete and the cause of the accident is
determined.''
<p>
   Another 31 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> warships and vessels from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Australia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canada</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Korea</ENAMEX> are training in another part of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX>,
near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>, They will continue their phase of the RIMPAC exercise
with live fire and missile shots, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yoshishige</ENAMEX> said. The exercise
began on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 22</TIMEX> and runs until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 21</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Scant details were available about the A-6E shootdown, which
occurred as the aircraft was towing an aerial target for the
Japanese warship to shoot with its Phalanx Close-In Weapons System
cannon on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>. The accident occurred at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:15 p.m.
Tuesday local time</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Toshinori Yanagiya</ENAMEX>, a senior <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense Ministry</ENAMEX> official in charge
of military training, told a news conference in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, ``The
accident may have happened because of some kind of mechanical
trouble (with the Phalanx system), but we still don't know the
cause.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> officials from the carrier USS Independence said the
A-6E and its target were far apart when the mishap occurred. ``The
tow(ed target) was between two or three miles behind the plane at
the time it was shot down,'' said Lt. Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeff Alderson</ENAMEX>, another
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX> spokesman.
<p>
   The Phalanx gun is a defensive weapon aboard both <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> and
Japanese warships and is used as a last-ditch protection against
missiles or aircraft. It uses a built-in radar to lock on the
approaching target and steer a stream of depleted uranium shells at
the target. The gun fires at a rate of 3,000 rounds per minute and
its range is between 1,625 and 6,000 yards.
<p>
   The A-6E was equipped with a towed target system, consisting of
a target drogue that is unreeled from a pod attached to the
aircraft fuselage. The target drogue, shaped like a missile with
stabilizing fins, is 12 inches in diameter and about 5 feet long.
Radar reflectors on its body generate an image the same size as a
tactical aircraft on warships' radar screens.
<p>
   ``We do this all the time for our ships,'' one A-6E pilot said
of the target towing mission. ``During workups (pre-deployment
training) it's very common for every ship in the battle group to
take some shots.''
<p>
   Standard procedure for using a towed target against a Phalanx
system is for the aircraft to stream the drogue about 3 miles
behind the aircraft, said the Intruder pilot, who asked that his
name not be used.
<p>
   The aircraft approaches the ship at an altitude of about 1,000
feet and an airspeed of 300 knots. Because of aerodynamic drag, the
target passes through the air at 500 feet  &MD;  the estimated target
height of a missile closing in on the warship, the pilot said.
<p>
   With the accident coming at a time of political strains between
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s security role in the post-Cold
War era and divisions inside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> military bases, the
Japanese government wasted no time in apologizing for the accident
that destroyed the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$30 million</NUMEX> bomber.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> quickly accepted <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s ``gracious'' apology,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Based ashore at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atsugi</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Medium Attack Squadron 115</ENAMEX> comes
under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attack Wing U.S. Pacific Fleet</ENAMEX>, with
headquarters at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey Island Naval Air Station</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oak Harbor</ENAMEX>.
Both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royster</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX> were stationed at other Intruder squadrons
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Whidbey Island</ENAMEX> before joining <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">VA 115</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">several years ago</TIMEX>,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Attack Wing</ENAMEX> commander Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Terry Toms</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Royster</ENAMEX> remains under medical care aboard the carrier with
facial lacerations that required minor surgery, while <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Douglas</ENAMEX>
underwent treatment and was released, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alderson</ENAMEX> said. The injuries
were believed to have occurred during the aircrew's ejection from
the aircraft, he said.
<p>
   The mishap occurred about 730 miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Midway Island</ENAMEX>, on
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">54th anniversary of the Battle of Midway</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 3, 1942</TIMEX>, where

ACCIDENTAL <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">ISRAEL</ENAMEX>: `MISHAPS' RAVAGE REFUGEES, `LIBERTY'
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)

<p>
   The recent Israeli shelling of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> refugee camp in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX> had striking similarities to an Israeli attack on a
non-combatant American ship sailing in international waters <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">29
years ago</TIMEX>. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 8, 1967</TIMEX>, Israeli air and naval forces attacked
the USS Liberty, a technical research ship, that was peacefully
sailing off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sinai Peninsula</ENAMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean Sea</ENAMEX>. The
Israelis used torpedoes, napalm and machine-gun fire to kill 34
Americans and wound 171 others.
<p>
   Just as the Israelis claimed the shelling of the refugee camp
was an accident, so too, did they claim that the attack on the USS
Liberty was an accident.
<p>
   There were other similarities:
<p>
   1. The use of extraordinary brutality.
<p>
   The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 18</TIMEX> shelling struck a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> peacekeepers' compound in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Lebanon">south Lebanon</ENAMEX> killing more than 100 men, women and children.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Knight-Ridder Newspapers</ENAMEX> reported that survivors were overcome by
the magnitude of the killing.
<p>
   ``Grown men staggered around the blood-soaked compound, weeping
uncontrollably. Wailing women threw themselves onto the burned and
mangled corpses of relatives. As they weaved among rows of bodies
shrouded with blankets, stepping over scattered body parts, even
some battle-hardened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.N.</ENAMEX> soldiers were in tears.''
<p>
   During the attack on the USS Liberty, the Israelis used unmarked
aircraft, jammed the ship's radios on both <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Navy</ENAMEX> tactical and
International Maritime Distress frequencies, destroyed by
machine-gun fire life rafts that had been dropped over the side by
crewmen preparing to abandon the ship, and refused to offer
immediate aid upon cessation of hostilities.
<p>
   2. The claim Israelis do not target innocent non-combatants.
<p>
   Reported <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> writer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Greg Myre</ENAMEX>, ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> says it
does not intentionally target civilians. . . . But the gray
gunboats off the port city of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sidon</ENAMEX>, 25 miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX>, fire
day and night at civilian cars heading south on what is normally
the country's busiest highway. Since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, three cars have been
destroyed after being hit by shrapnel, and three more have skidded
off the road and crashed in high-speed attempts to evade the
Israeli fire.''
<p>
   According to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Human Rights Watch</ENAMEX>, an organization that tracks
human-rights abuses worldwide, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> has displayed
``indiscriminate and disproportionate'' shelling of villages in
southern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>. While the human-rights report appropriately
condemns <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Hezbollah</ENAMEX> guerrillas for indiscriminately firing Katyusha
rockets into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>, it also documented <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s manifest
violations of international law including, ``Targeting whole
villages without specific military objectives and without regard
for civilian casualties; specifically targeting the civilian
infrastructure, including power stations and water reservoirs;
deliberately creating a refugee crisis to put pressure on the
Lebanese government; and deliberately targeting ambulances and
civilian vehicles.''
<p>
   A USS Liberty survivor, Lt. Cmdr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Edwin Lewis</ENAMEX>, says, ``The
Israelis obviously had sufficient time to plan their armament load.
There were apparently heat-seeking missiles used to take out the
tuning coil of every antenna, there were fragmentation bombs used
to take out the parabolic dish fore and aft. On the first strafing
run virtually all communications and all means of survival were
destroyed. If it was an accident, it was the best prepared accident
on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   3. The Israelis deny the attack was deliberate.
<p>
   An investigation by Maj. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Franklin van Kappen</ENAMEX>, a Dutch
military adviser to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX>, concluded, ``While the
possibility cannot be ruled out completely, it is unlikely that the
shelling of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> compound was the result of gross
technical and/or procedural errors.''
<p>
   The Los Angeles Times reported, ``The most damaging point of the
report  &MD;  and to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX>'s case  &MD;  has been proof that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> flew
surveillance aircraft over the camp while the firing was going on.
Contrary to repeated denials, two Israeli helicopters and a
remotely piloted vehicle were present in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qana</ENAMEX> area at the time
of the shelling. . . . <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> denied this to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Nations</ENAMEX> and
publicly until the British newspaper The Independent reported the
existence of an amateur videotape showing an Israeli pilotless
reconnaissance aircraft  &MD;  the kind used by artillery spotters to
perfect their aim  &MD;  over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Qana</ENAMEX> during the shelling.'' Once aware of
the videotape, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Israel</ENAMEX> changed its story.
<p>
   Finally, the most recent unbiased research into the assault on
the USS Liberty was conducted by Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Edgar Borne</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York
University</ENAMEX>. His detailed analysis concludes that ``the account of
the attack given by the Liberty men is the correct and truthful
one'' and that the attack ``was deliberate and that all available
evidence points to this conclusion.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  A sustained breakdown in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX>'s chain of
command was a leading factor in the plane crash that killed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and all 34 other people aboard in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Croatia</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two months ago</TIMEX>, the service said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> in its
official report on the accident.
<p>
   It was as a result of this breakdown, the report said, that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
Force</ENAMEX> commanders in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> had failed to make a safety inspection
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> airport whose outcome might have prevented the
crash.
<p>
   The report concluded, as previously published news accounts had
suggested it would, that pilot error, insufficient on-board
navigational equipment and poor airport design had also contributed
to the accident.
<p>
   But it said that the stormy weather in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> at the time had
not been a significant contributor and that all systems on the
aircraft had been working well. Also working, the report said, were
both radio-beacon systems on the ground at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>, contrary to
suspicions raised by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> in an
interview <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The report further concluded that contrary to an earlier account
by a longtime friend and business associate of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brown</ENAMEX>, it was
unlikely that he had pressured the flight crew to fly into
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX> in bad weather and make a dangerous landing there.
<p>
   The same officers, the report said, had resisted such pressure
on an earlier flight carrying high government officials.
<p>
   The report, more than 7,000 pages long, did not rank the causes
of the crash by significance. But General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ronald R. Fogleman</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> chief of staff, said at a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> briefing for reporters
that the most troubling problem was the breakdown in the chain of
command, or what the report called ``management complacency and
inadequate oversight.''
<p>
   The report said Brig. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William E. Stevens</ENAMEX>, commander of the
German-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">86th Airlift Wing</ENAMEX>, to which the jet belonged, had
directly contradicted an order issued months earlier by superiors
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> to check the safety design of previousy unchecked
European airports, like <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dubrovnik</ENAMEX>'s, into which his planes were
flying.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> and two deputies were relieved of their duties soon
after the crash and, officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, may face court-martial.
<p>
   ``The biggest question that I have from my level is how could we
have an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> instruction in the field that was not being
complied with at the major air-command level,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fogelman</ENAMEX> said. ``I
need to find the answer to that. In my view, that's the start of
this chain of events.''
<p>
   Much of the investigation's most damning material is contained
not in the 73-page central report but in more than 7,000 pages of
documentary evidence and deposition transcripts.
<p>
   The most explosive commentary collected by the investigators
came from Lt. Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James A. Albright</ENAMEX>, former commander of the
squadron to which the doomed plane belonged.
<p>
   In his testimony, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> described an atmosphere in which
safety concerns may sometimes have been secondary to on-time
performance, and in which pilots were required to fly jets with
outdated equipment into airports that offered only the most
primitive navigational aids.
<p>
   Powerful government officials and their staffs often demanded
that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> planes on which they traveled go to dangerous
destinations or fly through dangerous weather, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``I think there is an atmosphere of fear,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>, who
was removed from his command <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">five days before the crash</TIMEX> because of
differences with <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>, his superior. ``In the matrix of safety
versus mission, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> is mission first.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX> also said Maj. Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles R. Heflebower</ENAMEX>, the
commander of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">17th Air Force</ENAMEX>, the parent command of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>'
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">86th Airlift Wing</ENAMEX>, had a ``reputation for intimidation and pushing
pilots to do things that are blatantly illegal'' and had made
illegal and potentially dangerous manuevers in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> planes.
<p>
   In their own depositions, both <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heflebower</ENAMEX> denied
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albright</ENAMEX>'s accusations.
<p>
   Asked whether pilots under his command had ever voiced concern
about his policies, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heflebower</ENAMEX> replied, ``I not only don't recall
it, it didn't happen.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stevens</ENAMEX>, questioned closely by investigators, said safety had
been his first priority. But he also said that to do its work, his
unit had badly needed a waiver to use the commercially available
approaches, published by a company called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeppesen Standard</ENAMEX>, or to
have them checked and approved for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> use.
<p>
   He assigned a subordinate to the issue, he said, and ``however
we were flying <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Jeppesen</ENAMEX> approaches, I expected us to do it
legally.''
<p>
   The details of the ill-fated flight's last few minutes can never
be known, because the plane, a military version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737
that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> used for carrying ``distinguished visitors,''
did not carry a cockpit voice recorder or a flight data recorder,
as commercial planes must.

<p>
   Consider, for example, the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> chart, reproduced above,
that shows <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> with a high accident rate per 100,000
departures. The data also rank <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> as a better-than-average
airline, even though its four fatal crashes in that period raised
many safety concerns among travelers.
<p>
   An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Canada</ENAMEX> flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX> also illustrates the fuzziness of
such statistics. An <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ottawa</ENAMEX>-to-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edmonton</ENAMEX> flight ran out of fuel
halfway through the trip because the captain made a mistake in
calculating the fuel on board. But the same captain, who had some
handy experience as a glider pilot, was able to fly the hushed
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 767 to an air strip and land safely. Only two passengers
received minor injuries in what could have been a catastrophe.
<p>
   Sometimes the way an airline handles a mishap says more about
its safety than the mishap itself.
<p>
   Other statistics are based on a voluntary reporting system, so
an airline that shows a lot of write-ups on minor problems with
aircraft may actually be more vigilant than an airline with few
such reports.
<p>
   The value of that fine print may be questionable, and too much
scrutiny of the voluntarily filed reports may discourage some
airlines from filing them. But for some consumers, it may be
reassuring to have the data available anyway. And who knows, with
more people keeping close tabs on the airlines, complacency may be
less likely to creep in among airlines that are proud of their
records.
<p>
   The quickest and least expensive ways to find aviation
statistics, if you have a computer, is the Internet. There are rich
databases to mine  &MD;  including http://www.faa.gov and
http://www.landings.com  &MD;  that lead to even more databases,
including that of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Taking a virtual trip on the Internet also has the added benefit
of being safer than flying. That is, as long as you make sure your
computer's three-prong plug is safely grounded.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 27</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- Little light was shed on the
impending disaster that awaited <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flight 592 in air traffic
control tower tapes released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The tape covers 20 minutes of conversations between the control
tower at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dade County</ENAMEX> airport and several aircraft,
including the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> flight.
<p>
   The tape confirms what investigators already knew: that
approximately six minutes into the flight, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crew
reported trouble. ``Smoke in the cockpit, smoke in the cabin,'' the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crew told a flight controller in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Less than a minute later, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crew requested to land at
the ``closest airport available.'' Nine seconds later, the crew
contacted the control tower for the last time.
<p>
   Fourteen minutes after flight 592 took off, the air traffic
controller asked another plane flying in the area ``how did critter
(<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> 592) make out.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> is currently
investigating the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> accident, which investigators say may have
been caused by the explosion of oxygen cylinders in the plane's
cargo hold. A preliminary report on the accident will be released
``over the next few months'' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> spokesman said.

<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> may have found a key
clue in recent 737 crashes, but can't tell for sure because
inadequate flight data recorders on older jets don't provide
crucial details.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Board</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hall</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> blasted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> for sitting on an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> request that all commercial
jetliners be refitted with better ``black boxes'' to more
accurately record what goes on in aircraft during flight.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> responded by saying it is close to a recommendation, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">15
months after the safety board first urged the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> to make the
change</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> said a recent incident involving an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind Airlines</ENAMEX>
737 appears to be have been caused by a ``misrigged''
rudder-control device. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said the circumstances appear to be
similar to two still-unexplained crashes involving 737s. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> jet did not crash.
<p>
   Speculation on the causes of those crashes, which killed 157
people, has ranged from pilot error to design flaws in the 737.
Without better flight data, however, the investigation has been
difficult, and nothing has been proven.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s assertion about the rudder-controlling yaw damper drew
some skepticism from at least one safety expert, however, who said
the device couldn't move enough to have caused the crashes.
<p>
   In a polite but pointed letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Administrator <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David
Hinson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> cited four recent incidents involving an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind
Airlines</ENAMEX> 737-200 that unexpectedly rolled right while in flight. In
each incident, most recently on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 10</TIMEX>, the pilot was able to
correct the roll without further incident. The jet has been
grounded for investigation since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">then</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Investigation so far has revealed that the yaw damper  &MD;  an
automatic device that prevents side-to-side wiggle in a jetliner  &MD; 
was ``misrigged,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said, swinging 4.5 degrees in one direction
instead of 3 degrees as prescribed.
<p>
   ``Ongoing aerodynamic analyses have not confirmed precisely the
magnitude of the rudder deflection required to produce the roll
event,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> wrote to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hinson</ENAMEX>. ``Moreover, the pilots' actions
regarding pedal inputs cannot be determined. Unfortunately, the
investigation of this incident is severely hampered by the lack of
FDR (flight data recorder) data on the movement of the rudder
pedals and the associated rudder position.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> should have moved more quickly to implement
the change.
<p>
   ``Although the investigation of the recent <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind Airlines</ENAMEX>
incident continues, preliminary data suggest circumstances that are
similar to those of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> accident near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> accident near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX> wrote.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> crash killed 132 people on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 8, 1994</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX>
crash killed 25 people on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">March 3, 1991</TIMEX>. In both incidents, each
involving a 737, the planes plunged unexpectedly and crashed. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>
provides maintenance for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Flight data recordings from each flight were of little help. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United</ENAMEX> jet had an old-style, stylus-driven recorder that reacted
wildly and incorrectly during the crash. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> jet, like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX> jet, had a digital recorder which gathered only 11 basic
sets of data, including flight speed and some control-surface
locations.
<p>
   Newer black boxes, so-called because they frequently emerge
blackened from crash-related fires, digitally record hundreds of
data points, including the dispositions of all flight control
surfaces as well as many pilot actions.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX>-area pilot and flight-safety expert <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Nance</ENAMEX> applauded
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Hall</ENAMEX>'s call for flight data improvements, but said he doubts the
yaw damper could have caused the crashes.
<p>
   ``Yaw dampers simply do not have sufficient authority to deflect
the rudder far enough to create an upset,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   If any trouble occurs, pilots are instructed to shut yaw dampers
off, and they are not required equipment on commercial flights. Big
jets don't even use their rudders to turn in flight; turning is
accomplished by raising the ailerons along the trailing edge of the
wings, producing the wide, banked turns that jets have to make.
<p>
   Computer simulations of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> crash showed its fateful
plunge matched a rudder deflection of 17 degrees. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX> said
something would have to be broken for a rudder to move that much.
As <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX> pointed out, however, without better flight data
investigators have no way of knowing if that is what happened.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">Nearly two years</TIMEX> of investigation have failed to find a cause
for the crashes, either from design flaws in the 737 or from errors
farther down the line.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> has called for advanced training to help pilots recover
from unexpected flight events. Company spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Russ Young</ENAMEX> said
the company supports the call for better flight data recorders,
which are chosen by airline customers. The company earlier sent out
a service bulletin telling airlines what's needed to upgrade the
recorders.
<p>
   ``We continue to be involved in both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Eastwind</ENAMEX>
investigations providing whatever we can in the way of technical
expertise and experience,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Young</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nance</ENAMEX> said better flight data gathering is long overdue.
<p>
   ``I want video cameras and good microphones, not '50s-style
microphones,'' he said. ``If we're going to do it, let's do it
right.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said it plans to act on the recommendation soon. ``The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has developed a proposal based on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>'s recommendations
and expects to announce its conclusions shortly,'' said a statement
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> headquarters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX>

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Two passengers on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines</ENAMEX> flight from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pensacola</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> were killed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> when
an engine on the plane broke up as the jet was beginning to take
off, sending debris into the cabin.
<p>
   After the takeoff was aborted, five other people were injured
while being evacuated from the jet.
<p>
   The plane, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas</ENAMEX> MD-88 with its full capacity of
142 passengers and a crew of 5, was about 1,500 feet down the
runway when passengers reported seeing smoke from the left engine.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brenda Menard</ENAMEX>, a passenger on the plane traveling with her
husband, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean Paul</ENAMEX>, and 11-month-old child, told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated
Press</ENAMEX> that a piece of the engine had burst through the fuselage.
<p>
   ``There was part of it that went through to the other side,''
she said.
<p>
   Other passengers described what they said sounded like an
explosion or ``pop'' and an odor like burning plastic.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bruce Yelverton</ENAMEX>, director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Escambia County Emergency Medical
Services</ENAMEX>, said that a woman and a young boy were killed. Five
people were taken to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pensacola</ENAMEX> hospitals, including a 15-year-old
boy and his 9-year-old sister and three women, one of whom is
pregnant. All were listed in good condition.
<p>
   An injured man was evacuated by helicopter and was in serious
condition, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yelverton</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The engine, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX> JT8D, was similar to one that
broke up on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 as it was taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 1995</TIMEX>, badly injuring a flight attendant. After that accident,
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> called for more frequent
inspections of that type of engine, a JT8D-9a.
<p>
   Preliminary reports on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> were that the engines on
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> plane were JT8D-219s, which are slightly different.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Sullivan</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX>, said that the
company believes a fan blade in the front of the left engine
failed.
<p>
   Broken pieces of the blade probably penetrated the fan case and
debris went flying, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``We believe that is what happened,'' he said. ``But we have not
confirmed it because we haven't examined the engine.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> could not say on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> when the engine that
broke up was last inspected, or even how old it was. But a
spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dean Breest</ENAMEX>, said it was probably of about the same
vintage as the aircraft, which was delivered to the airline in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Both the MD-88 that was involved in the accident on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX>'s DC-9 have engines mounted close to the fuselage at the
rear of the plane. Their centers are about level with the middle of
the passenger window.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> that it was sending a team of six investigators to the
scene. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Benson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman, said that ``uncontained engine
failures,'' in which the spinning internal parts not only break up,
but break out of the engine, are rare but are ``one of the worst
things that can happen.''
<p>
   In the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> case, the shrapnel severed fuel lines, which
started a fire that destroyed the airplane on the runway. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May
1991</TIMEX>, a JT8D engine failure destroyed a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 727 freighter.
<p>
   But the accidents are rare relative to the number of hours of
service, and the engine is one of the most popular in civilian
aviation, in part because of its high reliability.
<p>
   The safety board's inspection recommendation arose from an
incident at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">La Guardia Airport</ENAMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Jan. 30</TIMEX>. An engine
on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 727 failed, throwing parts through the engine
cowling. The crew halted the takeoff and passengers were evacuated
without injury.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tennessee</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 8</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest Airlines
Co.</ENAMEX> jet skidded off the runway at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville International
Airport</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, injuring three passengers.
<p>
   The pilot of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 aborted during takeoff shortly
before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m.</TIMEX> after a bird flew into the engine on the left side of
the plane.
<p>
   The aircraft skidded off the runway and came to stop on grass
800 feet away, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ed Stewart</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   One passenger broke his leg and two others reported minor
injuries as they evacuated using emergency slides. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> said the
pilot called for portable stairs to be brought to the plane, but
the slides were deployed after some passengers reported seeing
smoke.
<p>
   ``Someone thought that there might be a fire on board,'' he
said. ``There's been no confirmation of any fire.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> said the plane appeared to have received only minor
damage to its tires and left-side engine. He didn't know when it
would re-enter service.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> Flight 436 flight originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Birmingham</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Alabama</ENAMEX>,
and was making a stop in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashville</ENAMEX> before continuing to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Most of the 122 passengers on board were placed on other flights
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stewart</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dallas</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> has the best safety record among major
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers. It hasn't had a major accident in its <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT" MIN="25 years">25 years of

<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 30</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Southwest</ENAMEX> flight carrying 134 people from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las
Vegas</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Burbank</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, made an emergency landing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ontario</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">California</ENAMEX>, after the left-side landing gear failed to fully
extend.

SAFETY BOARD FINDS MANUFACTURER AT FAULT IN <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> TURBOPROP CRASH
(HLW)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">MATTHEW L. WALD</ENAMEX>
c.<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">N.Y. Times News Service</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> said on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the main reason for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American
Eagle</ENAMEX> turboprop was that the French manufacturer and the French
government did not tell airlines, pilots, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> everything they knew about the model's vulnerability
to ice.
<p>
   They also failed to take appropriate corrective actions, the
board said.
<p>
   The final report on the crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, which killed
all 68 people on board, also found fault with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, saying that
it failed to monitor the airworthiness of the model closely enough
and failed to pay enough attention to the problem of ice for all
planes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s French counterpart, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Direction General a l'Aviation
Civile</ENAMEX>, known in this country as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">DGAC</ENAMEX>, submitted a lengthy
rebuttal to the report, which sought to blame the pilots and the
air traffic controllers; but the safety board found them mostly
blameless. The French manufacturer also vigorously contested the
findings.
<p>
   Neither the report nor the rebuttal were released on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>,
but the findings and the response were quoted from extensively at a
daylong meeting of the board. The board said its report had been
delayed six months to accommodate the French government.
<p>
   The plane, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> Flight 4184, was traveling from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, normally a hop of about 45 minutes, but
was holding over northwestern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> because bad weather had
created a backup at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">O'Hare International Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The pilots of the plane, an ATR-72, knew the weather conditions
could cause ice to form on the wings, but evidently believed that
turning on their anti-icing equipment and increasing the propeller
speed to force moisture away was adequate.
<p>
   But they were flying through an unusual meteorological condition
in which water droplets are larger than the plane was designed to
handle, which allowed ice to build up in ridges on the wing tops.
One of these ridges eventually disrupted the air flow and an
aileron  &MD;  a moveable surface on the wing that is used to make the
plane tilt left or right  &MD;  popped up suddenly.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> did not consider this kind of weather when it wrote the
rules for certifying aircraft. But as a result of the ice buildup,
the board said, the plane rolled over and plunged into a bean
field, traveling so fast that the wings were ripped apart on the
way down.
<p>
   An earlier, smaller version of the plane, the ATR-42, had shown
similar ``roll anomalies'' on several occasions in ice, notably in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1986</TIMEX>, near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Detroit</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Based on that incident and others, the plane's manufacturer,
then called <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avions Transport Regionale</ENAMEX>, sent out a brochure to warn
pilots about ice. But it did not say that an ice buildup could make
an aileron pop up, leading to a sudden roll.
<p>
   The board concluded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> that the brochure ``was
misleading and minimized the known catastrophic potential of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>
operations in freezing rain.'' And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, the board said, lacked
the ability to track incidents in a timely way and thus missed the
opportunity to spot the severity of the problem.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Hall</ENAMEX>, the board chairman, noted that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> had also made the
cause of the accident easy to find, because it had equipped the
plane with a flight data recorder that captured more than 100 kinds
of data. In contrast, the board is still struggling with two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>
737 crashes because the ``black boxes'' on that plane captured only
a handful of kinds of data.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Alain Brodin</ENAMEX>, the president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AIR Marketing</ENAMEX>, which markets the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> aircraft in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, said it was ``rather bizarre''
to call the brochure misleading, because it warned pilots not to
operate in ice.
<p>
   In a statement, the manufacturer said that the plane had been
operating ``well outside the certification envelope,'' or the
conditions in which it was proved safe to fly. The company passed
on all the information it had, the statement said, and ``based on
the knowledge available in the industry before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>
accident, the extreme icing scenario that led to the ATR-72
accident could not have been predicted from any of the previous
ATR-42 incidents.''
<p>
   The French government's representative to the inquiry, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yves
Lemercier</ENAMEX>, of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Bureau Enquetes-Accidents</ENAMEX> said the problem was
that the aircraft was put in a holding pattern ``right in the
freezing level.''
<p>
   The flight, he said, should have taken 45 minutes but waited 42
minutes on the ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indianapolis</ENAMEX>, flew for 20 minutes, and was
in the holding pattern for more than half an hour, until it
crashed. ``I cannot understand it,'' he said.
<p>
   In its response, the French government questioned why the plane
was put in a holding pattern, why the captain chose that time for a
five-minute trip to the lavatory, why the pilots were chatting
casually while in the holding pattern, and why they waited until an
anti-ice alarm chimed a second time before turning on some of the
anti-ice devices.
<p>
   At the meeting, the board said that turning on the anti-ice
system late made no difference, because the devices did not cover
the area where the ridge had built up.
<p>
   The company also said the pilots should not have been holding
with the flaps down. Aviation experts said they were doing so
because air traffic controllers had told them to fly at 175 knots,
just above the level at which the plane will fall out of the sky
without flaps. When the pilots were told to descend, the plane
speeded up, so they retracted the flaps, causing the plane to
change its angle relative to the wind, a change that magnified the
effect of the ice ridge.
<p>
   But the board concluded that nothing prohibited the use of the
flaps.
<p>
   Before the accident, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> had ordered small metal flaps
installed on ATR-42s to divert air in a way that would prevent ice
buildup; since the accident, the ATRs have been fitted with
expanded anti-ice gear and instructed not to hold in icing
conditions. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> also undertook a major study of all turboprop
aircraft and their vulnerability to ice.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The deadly crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> flight near
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX> may have been prevented had a
French aircraft manufacturer cautioned <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> officials on the
dangers of flying the plane in icy weather, federal investigators
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Concluding a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">20-month</TIMEX> investigation into the crash of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> ATR-72, which killed all 68 people aboard, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> also faulted the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Directorate
General for Civil Aviation</ENAMEX>, a French agency similar to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>, for not alerting airliners to the dangers.
<p>
   Investigators found that the ``probable cause'' of the crash was
the accumulation of ice on the wings of the turboprop aircraft,
which caused it to roll out of control and crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> said aircraft maker <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avions de Transport Regional</ENAMEX>, or
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX>, failed to disclose ``adequate information'' concerning the
severe effect that freezing rain would have on control of its
aircraft. The board also said that the French aviation agency
failed to take action to prevent ATR-72 mishaps in icy conditions
and that it also did not provide warnings.
<p>
   ``The real concern to me in this report was that the flight crew
did not have the level of information that other individuals in the
system had in regards to possible performance problems with the
aircraft,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> Chairman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Hall</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> board also found that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> could have done a better
job of overseeing <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> aircraft in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. The board
recommended that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> begin asking all manufacturers to provide
information about ``unsafe characteristics of flight'' to the
agency before aircraft are certified.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> officials said the company ``strongly'' disagrees with the
``inaccurate presentation made by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>.'' The company, in a
statement issued to reporters, said the report was ``incomplete and
focused on only some of the factors that contributed to the
accident.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> ignored the fact that the plane was flown for
more than 30 minutes in icy weather, ``well outside the aircraft
certification envelope.''
<p>
   At the time of the crash, the plane was in a holding pattern
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Indiana">northwest Indiana</ENAMEX>, waiting to land at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">O'Hare
International Airport</ENAMEX>. Radar showed that the flight was operating
in light to moderate icing, but the pilots did not report any
problems.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Pereira</ENAMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> investigator, said that on five other
occasions <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> aircraft had encountered icing problems serious
enough to cause sudden rolls during flight. He said pilots were
able to recover in those cases, but he criticized <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> for not
issuing written guidelines for flying in cold, icy weather
afterward.
<p>
   The board made several recommendations for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX>, a
unit of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Worth</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>. It said the airline
should:
<p>
    &MD;  Give flight crews more information about weather on routes
they will fly.
<p>
    &MD;  Encourage flight crews to concentrate solely on flight matters
in icy conditions.
<p>
    &MD;  Eliminate any conflicts in guidance and procedures in
published manuals.

EDITORIAL: ANOTHER AIRLINE SAFETY CHALLENGE
(th)

</PREAMBLE>
<TEXT>
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">New York Times</ENAMEX> said in an editorial on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Minday, July 15</TIMEX>:
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> has put most of the
blame for the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1994</TIMEX> crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> turboprop on
the French manufacturer and French aviation officials. According to
the board, the French failed to share developing knowledge of the
unusual effects of freezing rain and drizzle on the airliner at low
altitudes. Stuck in a holding pattern near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chicago</ENAMEX>, the plane went
down in an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Indiana</ENAMEX> bean field, killing all 68 people aboard, after
ice on its its wings forced it to spin violently out of control.
<p>
   The French, in turn, have sought to blame the American pilots,
but the board for the most part exonerated the crew while chiding
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> for inadequately prodding the
French. The board has yet to publish its full report so that its
reasoning can be tested, but its conclusions add to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s
mounting burdens, which include heavy criticism for the agency's
lax supervision of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet Airlines</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> dominates the manufacture of the world's jet
fleets, but airplanes like the ATR-72  &MD;  the choice of short-run
regional airlines  &MD;  are mostly produced abroad. Since the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ATR</ENAMEX> was
first certified for American domestic flights <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a decade ago</TIMEX>,
evidence has mounted that freezing rain and drizzle constitute a
danger for certain aircraft. The board now says the time has come
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> to set stricter rules for flying under those
conditions.
<p>
   The accident prompted two important corrections. The planes have
larger wing covers to prevent ice accumulation and pilots operate
under flight rules that minimize protracted holding patterns. But
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> will need to go further. It ought to take a stronger role
in evaluating the aircraft foreign makers vouch for  &MD;  and should
follow the safety board's advice to set higher standards for coping
with icing.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines Inc.</ENAMEX>
airplane bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> about 20
miles off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> with 229 people aboard, a
spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   No survivors had been reported shortly after <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midnight</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve
Sapp</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX>. The flight fell off the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> radar screens around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:45 p.m.</TIMEX>,
shortly after take off.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight 800 was bound from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy
International Airport</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles de Gaulle Airport</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike
Kelly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> vice president for airport operations, said in a press
conference. The plane was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> 747-100 and had last flown
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Eyewitnesses described seeing a series of explosions before the
plane went down, according to news reports.
<p>
   ``Anything is possible,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> said in response to questions
about the possibility of terrorist action. ``Security was at one of
the highest level you can have,'' and had been increased because of
the Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> units were ``finding bodies and bringing them on to
shore,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sapp</ENAMEX> said. He didn't know the number of bodies recovered
and said the search would continue as long as possible.
<p>
   The 747 is the world's largest airliner. The plane that went
down was a 747-100, which <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> produced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">from 1970 through 1986</TIMEX>.
It holds about 360 passengers in three classes.
<p>
   ``It's too soon to get any hard data on what happened,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Webb</ENAMEX>. ``We will cooperate fully with any
investigation. Our thoughts are with the victims' families.''
<p>
   The crash comes less than a year after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the airline's second
bankruptcy filing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">two years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The carrier has become competitive again by paring costs and
pulling out of money-losing routes. The 72-year-old carrier earlier
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> reported an almost fivefold increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX>
net income to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.3 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 cents</NUMEX> a share. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Jenkins</ENAMEX>,
vice-chairman of the international security firm <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroll Associates</ENAMEX>,
cautioned against jumping to a quick conclusion that the explosion
was caused by a terrorist bomb.
<p>
   ``We can crank our society up to a state of paranoia which is
unnecessary,'' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angles</ENAMEX>-based terrorism expert. ``Let's
get some more information before we go too far speculating.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> said that airport security measures have improved
significantly in recent years, in the wake of terrorist tragedies
like the downing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103 over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``As the result of extraordinary security measures, commercial
aviation, which was once one of the most popular targets of
international terrorism, was made a more difficult target.'' He
said attempts to hijack or plant bombs aboard aircraft have
decreased.
<p>
   A toll-free number has been set up for family members of people
on the flight. The number is (800) 438-9892.
<p>
   The crash comes two months after the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX>
flight crash in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> that killed all 110 people
aboard. That plane was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> DC-9-32.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was grounded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> one month after the
crash. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 has been involved in other accidents in its
almost 30-year history. Two of the jets collided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canary
Islands</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, killing 582 people in the world's worst aircraft
disaster.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan Air Lines</ENAMEX> 747 crashed into a mountain in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>,
killing 520 people. It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 747 that went down in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX> after terrorists planted a
bomb on the jet. That crash killed 270 people.

<p>
   ``Is that pyrotechnics in the sky?'' someone on the radio asked
Master Sgt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">D.M. Richardson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   He was in the cockpit of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX> helicopter on a
practice search-and-rescue mission off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> when the
practice ended and the grim reality began. For the orange flash was
not a fireworks display but a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> 747 crashing in
flames in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> a few miles from <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>'s home
base in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westhampton Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   A long moment later, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>'s chopper was circling over the
debris, the smoke and the ocean on fire.
<p>
   ``We saw this ball of fire coming down out of the sky,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>, the helicopter's flight engineer. ``It was a ball of
fire with black smoke, and it was descending.''
<p>
   The chopper had been practicing search patterns and rescue
maneuvers with a C-130 Hercules, a military cargo plane. The
C-130's pilot, Col. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Stratemeier</ENAMEX>, banked and turned to where
the passenger plane had gone down. ``We're in the rescue
business,'' he said. He and his crew were ``looking for signs of
life.''
<p>
   What they saw, he said, was flaming wreckage ``about the size of
a football field'' and 15 to 20 bodies in the water. He also said
he saw aircraft rescue slides floating in the water.
<p>
   The explosions rocked the quiet <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> on eastern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island</ENAMEX> and the orange fireball was confusing  &MD;  it was as if the
sunset was happening all over again, in fast-forward. On backyard
decks with binoculars, in boats with fishing poles, in crowded bars
with cool drinks in their hands, people watched and wondered and
worried.
<p>
   Like <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Victor S. Fehner</ENAMEX>, rocking on the water in his 17-foot
runabout, some thought it was a small plane ditching into the
water. But the explosions were too loud, the plumes of smoke too
big, to have come from a single-engine plane.
<p>
   And then all there was was a cloud over the ocean, and flaming
wreckage.
<p>
   ``It looked like the wing came off, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fehner</ENAMEX>, a 47-year-old
cable splicer. ``You could see two balls of flame, then everything
disappeared.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fehner</ENAMEX> figured it was a small plane with engine trouble, a
two-seater, that had landed close to the beach after a frightening
8-to-10-second descent. Not until he had tied up his boat and
called his son-in-law, a mechanic with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX>, did he
learn the scope of the disaster he had seen: The plane was a jumbo
jet bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> and carrying more than 200 passengers.
<p>
   ``It was round, like a tropical sunset,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Coyne</ENAMEX>, an
area manager for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Peace Corps</ENAMEX> who saw the explosion through the
sliding glass door of a condominium he had rented for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">the week</TIMEX> in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westhampton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX> ``There was a column of fire all the way to the
water, straight down.'' He said two explosions shook the apartment
as the fireball hit the water.
<p>
   It was crowded in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John Scott's Raw Bar</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westhampton Beach</ENAMEX>  &MD;  90
customers had been seated for dinner, and another 15 or so were at
the bar. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Ahrens</ENAMEX>, the bartender, was looking over a customer's
shoulder and out the big bay window.
<p>
   ``It was this comet-like explosion in the sky,'' he said. ``We
thought maybe it was fireworks.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX>'s helicopter had circled back to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Westhampton Beach</ENAMEX>
and picked up two pararescuers. One, Sgt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Craig Johnson</ENAMEX>, in a wet
suit, strapped himself to the side of the helicopter as it headed
back out over the ocean. By then <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richardson</ENAMEX> and the crew had put on
night-vision goggles.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Johnson</ENAMEX> had just finished a practice run and was on the tarmac
when he saw ``a red glow in the sky.''
<p>
   As they approached the stretch of ocean that was on fire, dozens
of bodies had floated to the surface and away from where the plane
had gone down, and were being carried away by the tide. He and Sgt.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shaun Brady</ENAMEX> began dropping light sticks used to mark bodies so the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> could collect the remains.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- All 229 people on board a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans
World Airlines</ENAMEX> jumbo jet are thought to have died when the plane
crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> in a ball of flames shortly after taking
off <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At least 30 bodies have so far been recovered, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cable News Network</ENAMEX> reports. No survivors have been found. A human
survival time of eight hours in the 65 degree Fahrenheit waters has
been passed, though some reports suggest a maximum survival time of
12 hours.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, disappeared from radar screens
around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 p.m. local time</TIMEX>. Among the passengers was a party of 16
teenagers from a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> high school.
<p>
   The 25-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747-100 aircraft was bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Charles de Gaulle Airport</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike Kelly</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> vice president for
airport operations, said in a press conference. The plane had flown
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">earlier yesterday</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Eyewitnesses described seeing a series of explosions before the
plane went down, according to news reports.
<p>
   ``Anything is possible,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kelly</ENAMEX> said in response to questions
about the possibility of terrorist action. ``Security was at one of
the highest levels you can have,'' and had been increased because
of the Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, he said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigations</ENAMEX> will take part in the
investigation at the crash scene, which has been established as a
crime site, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pete Cosgrove</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, police
commission said in a press conference.
<p>
   The plane was bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman said.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> produced that model of the world's largest airliner from
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1970 through 1986</TIMEX>. It holds about 360 passengers in three classes.
<p>
   ``It's too soon to get any hard data on what happened,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Webb</ENAMEX>. ``We will cooperate fully with any
investigation. Our thoughts are with the victims' families.'' A
two-person investigation crew will be sent by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> to the crash
site in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, he said.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 has been involved in other accidents in its
almost 30-year history. It was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 747 that went down in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>. Investigators eventually
determined that a terrorist bomb, hidden in a cassette player,
caused that crash that killed 270 people.
<p>
   Two of the jets collided in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Canary Islands</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>, killing
582 people in the world's worst aircraft disaster. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Japan
Air Lines</ENAMEX> 747 crashed into a mountain in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, killing 520 people.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Jenkins</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the international security firm
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kroll Associates</ENAMEX>, cautioned against jumping to a quick conclusion
that the explosion was caused by a terrorist bomb.
<p>
   ``We can crank our society up to a state of paranoia which is
unnecessary,'' said the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angles</ENAMEX>-based terrorism expert.
<p>
   ``Let's get some more information before we go too far
speculating.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jenkins</ENAMEX> said that airport security measures have improved
significantly in recent years, in the wake of terrorist tragedies.
<p>
   ``As the result of extraordinary security measures, commercial
aviation, which was once one of the most popular targets of
international terrorism, was made a more difficult target.''
<p>
   He said attempts to hijack or plant bombs aboard aircraft have
decreased.
<p>
   The crash comes two months after the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX> plane
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> in which all 110 people aboard were
killed. That plane was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX> DC-9.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> was grounded by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation
Administration</ENAMEX> one month after the crash.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mary Schiavo</ENAMEX>, Inspector General of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s parent agency, resigned
after charging the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> ignored its inspectors' warnings about
problems at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValueJet</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crash comes less than a year after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, the airline's second

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines
Inc.</ENAMEX> fell as much as <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">16 percent</NUMEX> amid concerns that <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>'s
fatal crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound jumbo jetliner will gut the airline's
financial rebound.
<p>
   All 228 people on board are believed to have been killed when
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing Co.</ENAMEX> 747 jetliner exploded and crashed into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   Officials said they haven't ruled out terrorism as a cause of
the blast, which came after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> heightened security in advance of
the Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``This is very serious for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Stempler</ENAMEX>, an
aviation consultant in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">D.C.</ENAMEX> ``It might finish them
off.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> emerged from its second bankruptcy in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Stempler</ENAMEX> likened <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s position to that of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan American World
Airways</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, after terrorists blew up a jumbo jet over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, killing 259 people. Passengers were afraid to
fly <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> after the crash, which contributed to the airline's
demise.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewins</ENAMEX> said the possibility of sabotage and the fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan AM</ENAMEX>
Flight 103 also was a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 inevitably will draw comparisons.
That could be detrimental if those comparisons stick in the minds
of travellers.
<p>
   ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> can weather it so long as it doesn't get a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103
image in the eyes of the public,'' he said.
<p>
   In late trading, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> shares fell 1 3/8 to 9 7/8 after trading as
low as 9 1/2 earlier in the session. It was one of the most-active
issues on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> markets, with about 6.97 million shares traded.
<p>
   Other airline stocks also fell amid speculation that the crash
and mounting concerns about airline safety could lead to a decline
in passenger traffic for all carriers. Shares of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AMR Corp.</ENAMEX>, the
parent of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, fell 3/4 to 81 1/8 and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta Air Lines
Inc.</ENAMEX> dropped 7/8 to 74 1/2.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Northwest Airlines Corp.</ENAMEX> delayed the release of its
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX> earnings, set for <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>, until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> because
of the crash.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash, one of the worst in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> history, follows other
aviation disasters including a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet Inc.</ENAMEX> DC-9
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> that killed 110 people, a crash in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Balkans</ENAMEX> of a
military version of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 that killed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Commerce</ENAMEX> Secretary
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ron Brown</ENAMEX> and the explosion of an engine on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Delta</ENAMEX> plane <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier
this month</TIMEX> that killed two people.
<p>
   At the same time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Harris</ENAMEX> said that comparisons to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>
crash are unwarranted. While <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>'s safety record has been
called into question, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s was excellent. Also, the airline is one
of the nation's oldest, having flown for 75 years. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> started
service <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years ago</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">Last night</TIMEX>'s crash came just hours after <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>-based <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
reported a fivefold increase in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">second-quarter</TIMEX> profit.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> earned <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$25.3 million</NUMEX>, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">46 cents</NUMEX> a share, compared with
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5.2 million</NUMEX> a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year earlier</TIMEX>. Revenue rose <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">12 percent</NUMEX> to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$965.8
million</NUMEX> from <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$860.5 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> announced an order for five MD-83 jets from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">McDonnell Douglas Corp.</ENAMEX>, with a commitment to buy as many as 10
more by the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">end of the year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The cost of the crash itself -- both the loss of the aircraft
and the potential liability for the deaths -- likely will be
covered by insurance carriers, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Lewins</ENAMEX>, an analyst with
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Gruntal &AMP; Co.</ENAMEX> Most airlines are insured for <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million to $3
million</NUMEX> per passenger in the event of a crash.
<p>
   ``From a financial standpoint, (the crash) is irrelevant,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lewins</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   Analysts said the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">multimillion-dollar</NUMEX> jet order, combined with
the strong earnings, indicated the airline was on the mend. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
struggled through two bankruptcy filing in recent years and even
resorted to using light bulbs and spare parts as collateral for
loans. It emerged from its last Chapter 11 reorganization in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">August</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Despite its long history, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> never has been an industry
pace-setter. The carrier has had several top managers, from
millionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Hughes</ENAMEX> to corporate raider <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX>, who knew
little about the airline business.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Icahn</ENAMEX>, who took control of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> through a hostile takeover in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>, feuded with labor and implemented brutal cost-cutting. His
tenure ended with the carrier's first bankruptcy.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, bound for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, disappeared from radar screens
around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 p.m. local time</TIMEX> shortly after taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>.

   Eyewitnesses described seeing a series of explosions before the

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> and top federal officials urged
Americans <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> not to ``jump to conclusions'' about the deadly
explosion aboard a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jumbo jetliner that crashed off
the southern coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Amid speculation that terrorists had destroyed the plane, the
president and his aides adopted a business-as-usual stance as they
awaited the outcome of a massive federal investigation into the
crash.
<p>
   All 228 passengers and crew on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 died when the
plane plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New
York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Aides said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> would travel to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> as scheduled on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> to address <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> Olympic athletes and take part in the
opening ceremonies of the 100th modern-era Olympics.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> urged the nation in a five-minute TV appearance: ``Do
not jump to conclusions. Let's wait until we get the facts.''
<p>
   Federal investigators ``do not know what caused this tragedy,''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> added. ``I want to say that again  &MD;  we do not know as of
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this moment</TIMEX> what caused this tragedy.''
<p>
   He questioned the authenticity of two telephoned claims of
responsibility for the explosion reported by Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet
Reno</ENAMEX>. ``Sometimes such calls are accurate,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said.
``Sometimes such calls are attempting to ride along on a tragedy.''
<p>
   The president recalled the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> bombing in which ``a
lot of people immediately concluded that this must have been done
by some force outside our country. It appears that that was not the
case now. So let's wait until we see the evidence.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, briefed throughout the day on crash developments by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> Chief of Staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon Panetta</ENAMEX>, kept a long-scheduled date
to address high school students representing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American
Legion</ENAMEX>-sponsored <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boys Nation</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Girls Nation</ENAMEX>. As a 16-year-old
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boys Nation</ENAMEX> representative from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arkansas</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> had himself come
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1963</TIMEX> to shake hands with President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John F.
Kennedy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Mentioning terrorism three times in a 29-minute talk to the
students in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">East Room</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> said he was ``determined that we
will find out what happened.'' He repeated his plea that Americans
should ``not to jump to any unwarranted conclusions about the
tragedy.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security</ENAMEX> Adviser <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Anthony Lake</ENAMEX> acknowledged that ``when
an aircraft explodes in mid-flight, you naturally think about
terrorism,'' but he emphasized that authorities ``do not have now
any hard evidence'' to explain the disaster.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake</ENAMEX> said it was important for the president and senior
officials to continue their public schedules regardless of whether
the explosion turns out to be a terrorist attack.
<p>
   ``If every time there is an incident that might have been
terrorist or that was a terrorist incident (and) we stop our
business, then the terrorists win.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake</ENAMEX> said at a luncheon
meeting with reporters.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Defense</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William Perry</ENAMEX> had warned that
American forces in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Persian Gulf</ENAMEX> region ought to be prepared
``for a very intense threat'' from terrorists in the weeks ahead,
following a terrorist bombing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 25</TIMEX> that
killed 19 GIs.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake</ENAMEX> said neither <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> nor any other American carrier had
been specifically targeted by foreign terrorists before <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s
crash.
<p>
   American intelligence agencies had detected evidence of
preparations for an attack on an American airliner before the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX> explosion aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 flight over
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, as well as a far-flung plot to bomb American
carriers operating in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> region before and during Pope
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Paul II</ENAMEX>'s visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Manila</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. In the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>
disaster, 270 people were killed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake</ENAMEX> said security at American airports has been tightened since
the conviction <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> of 10 Muslim militants for complicity in
the World Trade Center bombing that killed six and injured more
than 1,000 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Speculation mounted throughout the day <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that a bomb may
have caused the explosion aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> aircraft. Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Benjamin
Gilman</ENAMEX>, R-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">House International Relations
Committee</ENAMEX>, said, ``While all the evidence is not yet in, early
signs clearly point to a possibility of terrorism.''
<p>
   Rep. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Schumer</ENAMEX>, D-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> told him that
``either there was a bomb or the engine exploded and set a fuel
tank on fire.''
<p>
   A law enforcement official told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Associated Press</ENAMEX> that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was ``leaning more toward the possibility that it was a bomb
that caused the plane to explode'' based on eyewitness accounts
from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air National Guard</ENAMEX> pilots in the vicinity.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE  &MD;  OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Behind the public posture of business-as-usual, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
appeared to have shifted into a crisis management mode.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">Within two hours of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> explosion</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dick Clark</ENAMEX>, senior
director of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX>'s counter-terrorism
staff, summoned the first of at least four government-wide sessions
via a secure video teleconferencing system from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
situation room.
<p>
   The sessions linked representatives from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Central
Intelligence Agency</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> and other agencies.
They sought to coordinate the federal government's response as well
as ``just to make sure that we were looking at the potential
terrorist angle'' in the explosion, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lake</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Which House</ENAMEX> aides said it might take several days to reach a
conclusion about what caused the explosion. Investigators took
seven days to determine conclusively that a bomb had blown up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan
Am</ENAMEX> 103.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Federal law enforcement officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that
the most likely explanation for the fiery crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800
was that a bomb or, perhaps, a missile destroyed the airplane,
plunging it into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, killing all 230 people on board.
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, the remains of 120 people had been
recovered, and investigators had begun examining pieces of the
plane that were fished from the crash site and brought to land.
<p>
   The initial swirl of evidence and speculation on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>
produced several possible scenarios for the explosion that turned
the 747-100 airliner into a blazing shower at 13,700 feet above the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX>. Officials said the possibilities under investigation
range from a catastrophic mechanical failure that ignited the
airplane's 250,000 pounds of fuel, to a brazen act of terrorism,
like a bomb secreted on board or a surface-to-air missile fired
from below.
<p>
   But by process of elimination, investigators said they were
finding it increasingly difficult to find an explanation for the
explosion that ripped the aircraft apart that did not involve an
attack on the plane. However, they said they had only just begun to
examine physical evidence from the plane.
<p>
   Law enforcement officials involved in the investigation said
they had based their speculation about a missile attack largely on
the accounts of some witnesses who reported seeing flaming streaks
and flashes of light before the plane exploded, shortly after
taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Such a missile attack would be a frightening departure from
previous terrorist attacks on airliners. Efforts to deter terrorism
in this country have focused almost entirely on preventing
explosives from being brought aboard aircraft. But officials said
there were reasons, too, to be skeptical, including the fact that
Flight 800 was flying above the rated ceiling for most
shoulder-fired missiles, like the Stinger.
<p>
   Officials of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that they had
no immediate mechanical explanation for the crash. The plane did
not have a history of major mechanical troubles, they said, and the
experienced cockpit crew of the 747-100 did not report any problems
to air traffic controllers in the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">29 minutes</TIMEX> the plane was airborne
before disappearing from the radar screen at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:48 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   Although the inquiry officially remained an accident
investigation, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> was treating it as a criminal investigation,
far beyond its usual role in air crashes. Within hours of the
crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> had activated its joint terrorism task
force, bringing in other federal law enforcement agencies and the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> police. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, there were 100 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> agents
working on the case.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> cautioned against making
quick judgments about the cause of the crash. ``Do not jump to
conclusions,'' he said. ``Let's wait until we get the facts and
let's remember the families.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, said that ``the issue of an accident versus a
criminal act is very much out there'' and added that ``there is no
evidence at this point that this is not an accident.''
<p>
   Meanwhile, the huge rescue effort that began in the dark of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> continued in <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">daylight</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> with hundreds of
workers and dozens of boats trawling the placid water in the
200-square-mile crash site nine miles off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> coast.
<p>
   Throughout the day, there was a steady traffic of helicopters
and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> rescue boats ferrying bodies and pieces of the
airplane to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moriches Bay</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> station, where the
operation had its headquarters.
<p>
   Bodies were brought to a garage at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> station, then
tagged with numbers and loaded onto refrigerated trucks that took
them to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> medical examiner's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hauppauge</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Rabbi <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tuvia Teldon</ENAMEX>, who had come to the garage to say psalms for
the dead, said some of the bodies were fully intact and others were
mangled. Some were still in their seat belts. ``The vulnerability
of the human body becomes very apparent,'' he noted sadly.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wetli</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> medical examiner, said that
many of the bodies he saw were burned but that he believes the
passengers died ``in literally a heartbeat.''
<p>
   ``For all practical purposes,'' he said, ``it was an
instantaneous death.'' He added that out of regard for the
relatives of the victims, they would be asked to identify their
relatives through photos of their bodies.
<p>
   Throughout <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, relatives of victims continued to arrive at
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Plaza Hotel</ENAMEX> near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>, where they were
counseled while waiting for final word about the list of
passengers.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">SEATTLE</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 that exploded in flight <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> was
25 years old, but age is usually irrelevant in airliner accidents,
experts say. Properly maintained commercial aircraft will provide
decades of safe service.
<p>
   More than 50 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 707s (last built for commercial passenger
use in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1977</TIMEX>) still are flying; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Douglas</ENAMEX> DC-3s built in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1930s</TIMEX> fly
every day. The expected lifespan of B-52 bombers is 80 years.
<p>
   ``If the airplane wasn't any good it wouldn't get to be that
old,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Beyer</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Avmark International</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>-based
consulting firm.
<p>
   ``A well-maintained old airplane is probably much safer than a
poorly maintained new one,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bob Vandel</ENAMEX>, director of technical
projects for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Flight Safety Foundation</ENAMEX>, a non-profit
international research group.
<p>
   The <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> crash of a 27-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, despite
considerable speculation, did not turn out to be age-related. In
fact only one accident in the jet era has been conclusively traced
to an aircraft's age, a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> incident in which part of the top
ripped off an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aloha Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 in mid-flight. The jet had flown
thousands of cycles in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hawaii</ENAMEX>'s corrosive climate and paid for it
with the death of a flight attendant.
<p>
   The accident led to serious changes in maintenance of aging
aircraft. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> now requires a
schedule of repairs and inspections that increases as an aircraft
gets older.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Between 1970 and 1986</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> built 250 747-100s, 211 of which
are still in service. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX>'s ``maximum design service objective''
for the 747-100 is 20,000 flights, 60,000 hours and 20 years. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
standards prescribe extensive maintenance for an aircraft that
reaches its objectives,'' said spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Doug Webb</ENAMEX>. You can keep
flying an older plane; you just have to take more care of it.
<p>
   Experts say the 747 is not noted for problems or unexplained
crashes. The 747-100/200/300/SP series has an accident rate of 1.64
per million departures, better than the rate of 1.83 for all
commercial jets. In its 26-year-history, the jet has suffered 16
``hull losses,'' or irreparable accidents not related to sabotage
or military activity.
<p>
   ``Aging aircraft are only a problem if you don't maintain
them,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Michael Culver</ENAMEX>, managing director of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">First Equity</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>-based aerospace investment banking firm. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> is
pretty well-respected for their maintenance capabilities.'' Unlike
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> does its own maintenance and gets good marks for it.
<p>
   Even the engines, properly cared for, can run for decades. ``We
still have JT3s on the original 707s that fly every day,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Sullivan</ENAMEX>, spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>.
``Engine life is virtually unlimited from a mechanical standpoint
if you keep doing the overhauls. It's not like a car engine with a
big block that can go bad.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sullivan</ENAMEX> said available records on the doomed jet's JT9D engines
didn't show any serious problems, nor were they particularly old.
<p>
   Experts say economics usually dictates when aircraft get
replaced. Passengers like the amenities of newer aircraft, and
airlines save money on operating and maintenance costs.
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">first half of this decade</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airlines lost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10 billion</NUMEX>
 &MD;  more money than they had made in the entire history of commercial
aviation. Lack of capital has kept <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers from buying new
jets, pushing the average age of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> fleet to 11.8 years.
<p>
   ``That's true in general and specifically with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Culver</ENAMEX>. ``<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX> (former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> chairman) had no interest in
buying new planes.''
<p>
   That left <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> with the oldest fleet among major <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> carriers at
an average of 18.8 years.
<p>
   Passengers, on the whole, haven't been dissuaded from flying
older aircraft, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Seattle</ENAMEX> travel consultant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Danishek</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``People don't like 777s because they're new; they like them
because they've got lots of bells and whistles,'' he said. ``They
like 747s because they're big and roomy.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 jet that exploded on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>
south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, killing all 230 people on board, had a long
record of minor safety-related difficulties that are not unusual
for such aircraft.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> records show that the plane was
involved in two relatively minor incidents that did not result in
any injuries. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 1987</TIMEX>, it lost part of a tire during takeoff
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>. And in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1988</TIMEX>, an engine lost oil pressure
because an oil line started leaking.
<p>
   The airline filed 68 ``service difficulty reports'' on the
plane, according to an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> database. These reports, which concern
relatively minor problems, are filed voluntarily by airlines.
Aviation experts say that rather than reflecting problems with a
plane, a large number of such reports could signal an airline's
vigilance in addressing minor problems.
<p>
   The records indicate that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> plane that crashed, with a
tail number of N93119, had shown many signs of metal fatigue,
cracking, and corrosion, which is not uncommon for older aircraft.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet was 25 years old. The average age of jet aircraft in
service in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> is 15 years. Aviation experts say that
as long as an aircraft is maintained properly and subjected to more
frequent inspections as it ages, it is no less safe than a newer
plane.
<p>
   ``That number of service difficulty reports on metal fatigue
would not be unusual for a plane of this age,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Quinn</ENAMEX>,
an aviation lawyer in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A number of other minor problems were reported in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
records, including a nose landing gear that did not retract after
takeoff in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1989</TIMEX>, instances of food galley carts emitting smoke
in mid-flight, and several cases in which an engine was shut down
in mid-flight because of problems like low oil levels.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, like many other established airlines, does its own heavy
maintenance, and also does maintenance work for other airlines. Its
relatively good safety record is often mentioned in aviation
circles as evidence that a carrier's financial difficulties  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
has been in bankruptcy twice  &MD;  do not necessarily result in poorer
maintenance.
<p>
   According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has
been involved in two fatal accidents since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, neither of which
killed any passengers. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 1992</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dayton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ohio</ENAMEX>, a mechanic
was killed when an overinflated tire exploded during a repair
effort. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1994</TIMEX>, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> DC-9 collided on
takeoff with a small <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> aircraft that had wandered in its path.
The two <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Cessna</ENAMEX> passengers were killed.
<p>
   However, the safety board's records did not reflect an incident
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April 2, 1986</TIMEX>, when a bomb exploded under a seat on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rome</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, killing the passenger in the seat. Three other
passengers were sucked out of a hole in the fuselage. Investigators
determined that the small bomb had been planted by a Lebanese
terrorist.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 aircraft have been involved in fatal accidents at
other airlines that were caused in part by structural problems with
the planes.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October 1992</TIMEX>, for instance, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Al</ENAMEX> 747 crashed into an
apartment building shortly after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX>, killing
the 4 people on board and about 50 people on the ground.
Investigators determined that the crash was caused in part by
problems with the parts of the aircraft that attached the 747's
engines to the wings. A similar problem was found to have caused an
accident a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">year earlier</TIMEX> on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Airlines</ENAMEX> flight that crashed
near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taipei</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In recent years, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has issued dozens of so-called
airworthiness directives intended to prevent problems that were
discovered as a result of these and other accidents and incidents.
<p>
   The directives, which require changes to maintenance or
inspection procedures, include one in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1995</TIMEX> intended to
prevent fuel from leaking onto an engine and causing a fire on
certain 747 models; the plane that crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> was
one of those models. Another directive, issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this year</TIMEX>,
was intended to prevent separation of the rear section of the
fuselage from the airplane.
<p>
   A computer database that lists such directives did not include
details on what led to the measures.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EAST MORICHES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Investigators combed oil-slicked waters
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> for signs of a possible bomb or
extraordinary malfunction that could have caused <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 to
explode 21 minutes after takeoff <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>, killing all 230
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound travelers.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> warned against a rush to judgment, pointing to
the rash of unfounded reports of international terrorism that
attended the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX> bombing in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> blocked off acres of seashore and more than 200
square miles of ocean as a crime scene, and bodies piled up in two
makeshift morgues, aviation specialists said nothing but a bomb
could account for such a disaster.
<p>
   ``It has to be a bomb,'' said a highly placed federal
transportation source. ``We have never had an airplane blow up like
that from something mechanical happening inside the airplane. It's
not impossible. We have had an awful lot things happen in airplanes
in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">last 40 years</TIMEX>, but nothing like this. Kerosene just does not
explode.''
<p>
   The plane, an early-vintage <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 bought by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1971</TIMEX>,
burst into flames and fell in chunks into the waters off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East
Moriches Inlet</ENAMEX> at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 Wednesday night</TIMEX>, as vacationers in
pleasure boats and at seaside restaurants stared in horror.
<p>
   Within minutes, witnesses recalled <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Coast Guard</ENAMEX>
put out an unusual request over CB radios for civilian help in the
rescue effort. Hundreds of boats answered the request, bobbing in
the ocean all night in a flotilla that some likened to the famous
rescue of British troops during the Battle of Dunkirk.
<p>
   But by dawn, it became clear to the exhausted rescuers that
there would be no survivors.
<p>
   Among the dead were American, French and other European
nationals of all ages and backgrounds. They include an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edgartown</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> couple journeying to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> for a romantic celebration of the
wife's <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">80th birthday</TIMEX>; a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bridgewater</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX> man, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Andrew Krukar</ENAMEX>,
carrying a diamond ring with which he planned to propose to his
girlfriend; a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Harvard College</ENAMEX> hockey star; and 16 students
from a French class at a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pennsylvania</ENAMEX> high school, along with five
adult chaperones.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> officials withheld release of the full passenger list
pending notification of relatives. The airline said, however, that
the number of dead was 230, not 229 as reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
One of the flight attendents, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Warren A. Dodge</ENAMEX>, 49, was from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ashland</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> Two of the four cockpit crew members were from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Connecticut</ENAMEX>, Captain <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steve Snyder</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stratford</ENAMEX>, and Flight Engineer
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Campbell</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ridgefield</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   When the rescue efforts ended, the investigation began. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
agents closed off the site and investigators began retrieving
pieces of the shattered plane. Helicopters spotted the wreckage,
which was then picked up by boats and piled on the deck of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast
Guard</ENAMEX> cutters in two piles: plane parts, and personal items.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, cautioned at an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> press conference, ``We have
no evidence at this point that it was not an accident.''
<p>
   ``We are not ready to say what this is at this point,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim
Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, chief of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> anti-terrorism task force at an <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>
briefing. But, he added, ``we will get to the bottom of this,
whatever it is.''
<p>
   But aeronautics sources said a likelier explanation would be a
terrorist bomb, similar to the one that destroyed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103
in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December, 1988</TIMEX>. With hundreds of thousands of athletes and
visitors converging on the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>'s opening
of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> Summer Olympic Games in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, the spectre of
terrorism struck an extra note of alarm: Security was stepped up at
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hartsfield Airport</ENAMEX> to protect the arriving Olympians.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Massachusetts Port Authority</ENAMEX> officials put security
teams on alert and deployed more <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Police</ENAMEX> officers around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Logan
International Airport</ENAMEX>. Travelers, hearing of this crash on the
heels of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last May</TIMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> that killed all 110 on
board, expressed heightened concern about air-travel safety.
<p>
   Among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>'s other developments:
<p>
    &MD; A <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> TV station, along with other news organizations,
reported receiving calls from terrorist groups claiming credit for
bombing Flight 800, but the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> refused to comment on
whether any of them could be genuine. ``We're aware of several
call-in threats,'' but ``we're not going to characterize any of
them at this point,'' a department spokeswoman said.
<p>
    &MD; An arabic language newspaper reportedly received a letter
before the crash promising a surprise attack on Americans. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State
Department</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Nicholas Burns</ENAMEX> said the letter was ``a general
political tract,'' not related to the crash.
<p>
    &MD; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> officials confirmed that the 747 had arrived in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late Wednesday afternoon</TIMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>' <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hellenikon Airport</ENAMEX>, which was
declared unsafe by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</TIMEX>
for lax security. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, after repeated entreaties from the Greek
government, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> lifted the
warning about the airport, saying reinspections had revealed it to
be secure. Greek officials said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that the plane was under
armed guard during its layover in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>.
<p>
    &MD; A <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crew member who was at the controls of the 747 on the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> flight expressed his confidence that nothing was
wrong with the plane's mechanics. Flight Engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Albert J. Mundo</ENAMEX>,
62, looking shaken as he returned to his <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Marblehead</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mass.</ENAMEX> home,
said, ``The airplane was fine.'' He added, ``I lost several close
friends, and I just don't feel like talking now.''
<p>
    &MD; The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Navy</ENAMEX> will provide investigators with sophisticated radar
tapes of the plane's final minutes, according to sources close to
the probe. The radar could disclose evidence of any small aircraft
or missile in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> area at the time of the crash.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> radar reportedly detected a blip
merging with the jet shortly before the explosion. An an evening
briefing, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> spokesman said there was no evidence of a missile
or small plane in the crash area.
<p>
    &MD; An hour-long delay on the ground at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy
Airport</ENAMEX> was attributed to two separate problems related to the
baggage hold, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Abels</ENAMEX> said. Handlers retrieved a
suitcase checked on the plane by a traveler who failed to get on
board; bags checked by people who do not get on the flight are
considered grave security risks. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX> said the passenger
showed up just as the bag was removed. An additional half-hour
delay occurred when a mechanical baggage ramp malfunctioned, and
had to be towed away, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
    &MD; Federal sources said the plane's cockpit crew did not issue a
distress call, suggesting that the jumbo jet exploded so suddenly
the crew never knew what happened. Investigators have yet to locate
either the cockpit data recorder or the voice recorder. But
officials expressed confidence that both would be found, despite
the 140-foot seas into which the plane plunged.
<p>
   The apparent suddenness of the explosion fueled widespread
speculation of a terrorist bombing. In other cases where 747s have
had catastrophies at high altitudes, pilots were able to either
land the plane or at least issue a warning.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX> 747 was more than four miles in the
air when a cargo door blew off, ripping a hole in the plane. Nine
passengers were sucked out, but the pilot was able to land in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX>. When Soviet fighters shot down a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Korean Air Lines</ENAMEX> 747 in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1983</TIMEX>, the crew had time to radio air-traffic controllers.
<p>
   ``Planes like the 747 just don't go down like this one did,''
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Darryl Jenkins</ENAMEX>, president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aviation Foundation</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Investigators will closely monitor debris for any signs of an
explosive device, sources said. Molecular traces of bomb material
could attach to metal, cloth or even flesh. Bombs also shoot
shrapnel, leaving a distinctive pattern of small holes with metal
edges splayed outward. The pattern is different from the damage
caused by mechanical failure, such as an engine falling off, which
would slash wide gashes in the fuselage.
<p>
   ``It won't look the same,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Crippen</ENAMEX>, an explosives expert
with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Colorado Bureau of Investigation</ENAMEX>, said of structural
failures. ``You'll get a big gaping hole.''
<p>
   Eyewitnesses described the final seconds of Flight 800 as a huge
explosion, reminiscent of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1986</TIMEX> explosion of the Space Shuttle
Challenger.
<p>
   ``It looked like a flare at first, then got real big, real wide,
and you knew it wasn't a flare,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Simmons</ENAMEX>, who was
aboard a nearby pleasure boat. ``You knew it was something bad. You
just watched a big ball of flame go right back into the water. Then
you saw the smoke. Then you heard four big booms like thunder.''
<p>
   Lieutenant <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevin Dunn</ENAMEX>, commander of the first ship on the scene
of the crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> cutter Adak, said, ``We were on
patrol south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30</TIMEX> and all of a sudden we saw
a fireball, then a string of brilliant flames. We couldn't tell it
was an aircraft at first, but we followed a trail of flames and
debris to the site and when we got there, we knew. At first, i
thought it was a small aircraft. i had no idea it was a jumbo
jet.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dunn</ENAMEX> added, ``Our crew was the first to pull out bodies, and we
pulled out the first one about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">one hour after the explosion
occurred</TIMEX>. Most of the bodies were intact, but others had very
serious injuries. It appeared from the amount of wreckage and the
kinds of injuries that everybody died quickly and that none of them
had any idea what was happening to them.''
<p>
   By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late Thursday</TIMEX>, 140 bodies had been retrieved, according to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> Coroner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V. Whetli</ENAMEX>. He said there
was no way anyone could have survived the crash, which he described
as having the same impact as striking a wall at 200 miles per hour.
Only two bodies had been positively identified as of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late last
night</TIMEX>; others will require dental records  &MD;  which will be a problem
because so many of the bodies appear to be teenagers with good
teeth, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Whetli</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   As rescuers worked through the day, vacationers and residents in
the tiny village of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">East Moriches</ENAMEX> opened their homes and stores to
the thousands of visitors from around the world.
<p>
   The crash, they said, touched them in a way they'll never
forget, especially those who participated in the all-night rescue
efforts. Among the items they recalled pulling from the water: A
postcard written in German, a ladies coat, a Norton Anthology of
poetry, and a picture of a small dog.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tokyo</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 19</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- Japanese authorities probing the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Airlines</ENAMEX> jet in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nagoya</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>, said pilot
error was to blame for the accident, which left 264 people dead.
<p>
   But the investigators said design flaws in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus Industrie</ENAMEX>
A300-600R jet may have contributed to the disaster.
<p>
   The crash caused international controversy and sparked a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250
million</NUMEX> lawsuit after tests showed the co-pilot had been legally
drunk under Japanese law.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s flag carrier, claims the co-pilot was a
teetotaler and says alcohol could have been present because of
decay in his body before the tests were made.
<p>
   According to the report released <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> by <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Japan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aircraft
Investigation Commission</ENAMEX>, the co-pilot, who was flying the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX>
jet as it approached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nagoya Airport</ENAMEX>, caused the crash when he
accidentally set the jet's controls to abort the landing.
<p>
   It said the co-pilot didn't understand the purpose of the
automatic abort switch, the so-called ``go'' lever, and the pilot
was late in seeking to regain control from the co-pilot.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> was also to blame, according to the report, because its
autopilot system didn't have an audio warning system to alert
pilots, or a method of manual override when the plane was in
danger.
<p>
   The report claimed there had been three similar incidents at
separate airlines, though it provided no details, and faulted
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> for not moving more firmly to address the problem. It said
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Toulouse</ENAMEX>-based plane manufacturer had sent a warning to
airlines, without making it a mandatory repair order.
<p>
   Japanese authorities also said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX>'s flight crew operations
manual was unhelpful and, in certain sections, confusing.
<p>
   In a statement, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> said it had received the report, plans to
review its recommendations and ``will take action where
appropriate.'' A spokesman wouldn't comment further.
<p>
   The Japanese report didn't address whether the pilots had been
drinking. Taiwanese aviation officials, who accept the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China
Airlines</ENAMEX> explanation, have criticized the Japanese probe for not
addressing the issue, saying they want to clear the pilots.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">China Airlines</ENAMEX> was unavailable for comment. The carrier has had
a string of accident and unusual incidents, such as hard landings
and runway overshoots, in recent years.
<p>
   After five of the incidents in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Taiwan</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Civil Aeronautics
Administration</ENAMEX> suspended two pilots and ordered a new training
program for its pilots.
<p>
   The lawsuit over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nagoya</ENAMEX> crash, filed in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Nagoya District
Court</ENAMEX>, cites both the airline and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> as defendants.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Airbus</ENAMEX> is a partnership owned by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">British Aerospace Plc</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Daimler Benz AG</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Aerospatiale</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" MIN="Casa">Casa of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Spain</ENAMEX></ENAMEX>.

<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> waters 70 miles east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>, investigators
scour the dark depths for clues to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747's fiery crash.
<p>
   In coming days, they hope to recover victims' bodies and
identify them  &MD;  not just for humanitarian reasons. By comparing the
most severely injured passengers with their assigned seats, experts
may determine which part of the plane depressurized first  &MD;  and
whether a bomb is to blame.
<p>
   To explain the disaster, investigators hope to collect more
plane fragments and to reassemble them; to analyze possible
chemical changes and burn marks on aircraft ruins; to map any skid
marks and craters etched by hurtling debris on cabin walls; and to
recover the plane's data and voice recorders.
<p>
   The voice recorder may have taped eerie sounds  &MD;  perhaps the
frantic beep of an alarm, or the vibration of a struggling engine,
or the concussion of an explosion.
<p>
   ``The wreckage site is like an archaeological dig,'' said Dr.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kadlec</ENAMEX>, a top aviation accident expert for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Failure Analysis
Associates</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX>. ``But you have a moving target with
wreckage distributed on the water: You can see what I mean if you
ever dropped a little bit of ink in a pan of water, then moved the
water  &MD;  you can see that the ink spreads out over time.''
<p>
   The flight recorders also contain beacons that transmit signals
detectable for up to 30 days, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ted Lopatkiewicz</ENAMEX>, a spokesman
for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>. ``What you hope, when
you find the (recorder) box, is that you find a lot of wreckage
with it.''
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, board investigators fished debris from the waves,
including burned bodies, limbs, seats and parts of a wing. They
used sonar in a search for the voice and data recorders and the
aircraft engines, among other components.
<p>
   Victims may be identified by their fingerprints, dental records
or their DNA.
<p>
   Still, wreckage recovery could be easier than it was after the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> DC-9 crash in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX>, where the plane disappeared
into a muddy swamp. In that case, the mud prevented investigators
from using sonar to locate the voice and data recorders. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> recorders were eventually located with hand-held probes.
<p>
   ``Sometimes (oceanic recovery) is not quite as difficult as it
would seem,'' said aviation crash attorney <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Arthur Alan Wolk</ENAMEX> of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Philadelphia</ENAMEX>. ``This aircraft is only in about 140 feet of water.
... There's a lot of sophisticated gear that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> has that has
proven itself able to recover (debris) from up to 15,000 feet.''
<p>
   Scouring 1,000 square miles, authorities recovered more than
10,000 fragments from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103, a 747 downed by a bomb
while six miles over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>. The disaster
killed 259 people.
<p>
   In that case, researchers located debris with helicopters,
infrared scanners and spy satellite photos. They also told search
teams: ``If it's not growing and it's not a rock, pick it up,''
according to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1990</TIMEX> book ``The Fall of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103'' by
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Emerson</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Brian Duffy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   They blamed the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> blast on a terrorist bomb. Thanks to
microscopic analysis, they even identified the make of the stereo
in which the bomb had been stored  &MD;  a boom box sold only in
northern <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">the Middle East</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Analysis of the sound recorder is especially important, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolk</ENAMEX>
notes. If a bomb caused <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s crash, the sound of its blast
might be audible on the recorder, ``depending on the kind of
explosion. If (the blast) is right below the cockpit, it can be a
rather loud report.''
<p>
   ``(But) if it happened in the tanks or elsewhere, the sound
could be more muffled.''
<p>
   Once fragments are recovered, scientists will analyze them for
signs of a blast  &MD;  say, metal curled outward ``like a peeled
banana,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wolk</ENAMEX> said. By fitting the pieces together and examining
the patterns of curled metal, analysts might learn whether a bomb
was involved and where it was located.
<p>
   Also, ``materials change under intense temperature,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kadlec</ENAMEX>, who has a doctorate in aeronautical engineering from
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Stanford University</ENAMEX>. ``If you have an explosion, (its) chemical
remnants can be identified. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> has a catalog of every
conceivable explosive on the face of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Earth</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   Even if preliminary analysis reveals signs of explosion, ``an
explosion doesn't necessarily have to mean a bomb (was involved),''
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kadlec</ENAMEX> cautioned. ``There have been famous air crashes where rapid
depressurization of the cargo hold ... causes the aircraft to break
up like an explosion.''
<p>
   He warned news media: ``Don't jump to conclusions, don't
speculate, don't come to conclusions (based on) incomplete
information. I don't think you can rule anything out at this
point.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">EAST MORICHES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> moved closer to declaring
the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> an act of sabotage, as
investigators pored over debris for signs of a sudden explosion
aboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound 747.
<p>
   Preliminary examination of pieces of the wreckage points to an
explosive device aboard the plane, federal sources said, but
significant questions remain and much of the evidence seems
inconclusive.
<p>
   ``They think, from the pieces that have come up, that it may
have been a device, based on patterns, marks and holes,'' a federal
source close to the investigation said. ``But they still need to
get it under a microscope, and that hasn't been done yet. There are
also people at the makeshift morgue looking for rug or floor
material that may have been driven up into bodies from a cargo hold
explosion. So far that is a negative.''
<p>
   The bodies recovered so far  &MD;  100 whole corpses and numerous
additional body parts  &MD;  do not contain microscopic traces of metal,
which probably would be evident if a bomb made of metal were used,
said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles V. Wetli</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> medical examiner. Plastic
explosives would not give off such traces.
<p>
   The remains were not charred, as they would have been if a bomb
were in the passenger cabin, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetli</ENAMEX> added. The crash killed 230
passengers and crew members.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> agent in charge of the investigation,
emphasized that he is not yet ready to declare the crash an act of
terrorism, but his anger seemed to indicate otherwise.
<p>
   ``Anyone who would do this to a fellow human being is a
coward,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s president and CEO, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Erickson</ENAMEX>, also suggested that
the crash was not an accident. ``There's been no indication of a
mechanical problem,'' he said.
<p>
   Pounding seas off the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, which sickened
rescuers and severely hampered efforts to retrieve pieces of the
jet, prevented divers from raising the largest chunk of wreckage,
discovered about 120 feet deep. Searchers have yet to pinpoint the
whereabouts of the flight data recorder or cockpit voice recorder.
<p>
   ``We have the people here, we have the equipment and we have a
plan, but the weather is not cooperating,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>,
vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, at a
briefing <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>. The most important goal, he said, is to
recover the aircraft's flight recorders.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> did reveal that the jet was equipped with another
automated flight data system that routinely communicates engine and
other mechanical information to ground observers. A signal from
that system indicated that the jet's engines were operating
normally one minute after takeoff. ``There were no anomalies in
that,'' he said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> also said that less than <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of the total wreckage
has been recovered so far.
<p>
   For his part, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> somewhat edgily defended the
pace of the investigation. No cause was identified for the World
Trade Center bombing for 2 days, he said.
<p>
   Among <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>'s other developments:
<p>
    &MD; Unidentified sources quoted by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC News</ENAMEX> said a federal agency
received a claim of responsibility for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> explosion from a
group tied to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX>. He is now on federal trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York
City</ENAMEX>, accused of plotting to blow up 12 <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">West Coast</ENAMEX>-bound airliners
in a single day in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>, 29, who says he is innocent and is representing himself
at the federal trial, is also accused of bombing a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippines
Airlines</ENAMEX> flight in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1994</TIMEX>, killing a Japanese passenger.
Authorities also believe <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> was the mastermind of the World
Trade Center bombing in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">February 1993</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The group said the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> explosion was in retaliation for <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>'s
capture, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ABC</ENAMEX> said. An <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> spokesman refused to comment.
<p>
    &MD; Investigators traveled to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, where the 747 spent much of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>. The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> airport was declared a security risk
by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">US Department of Transportation</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last March</TIMEX>, prompting
published warnings on all tickets for flights to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>. In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>,
however, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> lifted the ban.
Authorities are closely studying the names on the passenger list
for the 747 flight from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>, to see if one might be
linked to a terrorist group. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CBS News</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX> that a
Lebanese citizen on a terrorist watch list had sought to board the
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> aircraft in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, but that neither he nor his baggage
made it on the plane.
<p>
    &MD; The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> has ruled out the possibility that the plane was
hit by a missile fired from a shoulder-launcher on land, believing
the jet was too far off the coast to have been within range of a
missile shot from land. They are continuing to investigate the
possibility, however remote, that a water-based launcher was used,
sources said. A witness reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> that he saw flare-like
flashes in the sky before the plane exploded. But the witness,
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Guard</ENAMEX> Maj. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fred Meyer</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, ``There was nothing I
observed that gave me any indication that the streak of light I saw
was caused by a missile. I don't know what I saw.''
<p>
    &MD; <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX> denied reports that some of the luggage on the
plane may not have been X-rayed for explosives. But an aviation
security expert said the airline's difficulty in producing a
complete passenger list raises questions about whether it kept
proper track of the bags on board. One additional New Englander,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elaine Loffredo</ENAMEX>, 50, an off-duty <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> employee from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Glastonbury</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, was added to the list of victims <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   At the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Inn</ENAMEX> at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">John F. Kennedy airport</ENAMEX>, family
members of victims from around the world prepared to begin the
process of identifying their loved ones. An estimated 110 families
congregated at the hotel, where reactions ranged from anger to
grief to a kind of mournful acceptance.
<p>
   They will not be given opportunities to see the bodies, most of
which bear signs of severe disfigurement. About <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75 percent</NUMEX> of the
victims were found without clothes.
<p>
   Family members are being asked to provide pictures of their
loved ones in smiling poses, from which forensic experts will
attempt to identify the corpses by their teeth.
<p>
   While some relatives of the victims appeared on television to
express their shock and grief, others betrayed little emotion.
<p>
   ``It's different from a car accident because of the numbers and
the disbelief, but the feelings are the same because it's a sudden
loss. It's just on a much bigger scale,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rhoda Cataldo</ENAMEX>, a
social worker from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kings Park Psychiatric Center</ENAMEX> on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>,
describing the relatives of the victims she counseled.
<p>
   Investigators privately briefed the relatives. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leah Lapidus</ENAMEX>, a
mental-health specialist with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Red Cross</ENAMEX> who attended the
meeting, said the family members told the agents their top priority
is recovering the remains of their loved ones. Only five bodies had
been positively identified as of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rudolph Giuliani</ENAMEX> spent time at the hotel for a
second day, continuing to press <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> for a complete passenger list.
The mayor, who lost a friend in the crash, continued to berate <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
for its alleged slowness in providing information to families.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LONDON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  As the chief executive of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>),
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffrey Erickson</ENAMEX>, raced back from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> to
take charge of the airline's investigation into the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
Flight 800, uncomfortable memories loomed large of the fate that
befell another American pioneer of the skies.
<p>
   The bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight 103 over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1987</TIMEX> marked
the beginning of the end for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s most famous flag-carrier.
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> sapped what little consumer confidence <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> still
commanded.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">Within five years</TIMEX> the airline which invented the transatlantic
clipper service was gone, its international routes and hubs
auctioned off to rival airlines and the rump of the business left
to wither and die in bankruptcy protection.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> is not <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>. The skids were already under <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> long
before the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX> disaster as a result of its failure to react
quickly enough to the deregulation of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> airline market. It
was also the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> flag-carrier without a home base.
<p>
   By contrast <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has big hub operations at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
and ranks as the world's thirteenth largest airline, carrying 21
million passengers <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>.
<p>
   But there are also some startling similarities. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, like <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan
Am</ENAMEX>, has had a torrid time since the world airline industry went
into recession at the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">end of the 1980s</TIMEX>.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, then under the control of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> corporate raider
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Carl Icahn</ENAMEX>, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> were both forced to sell off their routes
from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> to survive.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s were sold to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United
Airlines</ENAMEX>. But it did neither struggling carrier much good. Within a
year <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> was filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, as rising
oil prices, the Gulf War and intense competition took their toll.
<p>
   It survived and emerged from Chapter 11 <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year later</TIMEX> only to
return to bankruptcy protection in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>. It re-emerged following an
employee buyout backed by a handful of Wall Street institutions but
it remains saddled with debts of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.5 billion</NUMEX>.
<p>
   Since its founding in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">late 1920s</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has been associated
with some famous initiatives and famous names.
<p>
   It was the first to launch an innovative rail and air trip from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> that slashed coast-to-coast travel time to
48 hours.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1939</TIMEX> it was bought by the billionaire <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Hughes</ENAMEX> who
finally sold out in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1965</TIMEX>, by which time <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> was among the world's
top three carriers.
<p>
   Under <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> has big plans for the airline. At present it
operates only one flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX>  &MD;  from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gatwick</ENAMEX>  &MD; 
but wants permission to re-introduce daily services from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Heathrow</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   By coincidence <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX> was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Britain</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> as
Flight 800 took off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JFK airport</ENAMEX>, lobbying MPs on the subject.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Erickson</ENAMEX> also wants to replace many of the aircraft in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s
189-strong fleet, the oldest in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>'s disaster off
the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> may have put paid to that and much more
besides.

   What Do You See?
<p>
   Just look at the two police sketches, released a week apart, of
the suspect in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Central Park</ENAMEX> beating case <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last month</TIMEX>. Neither
sketch  &MD;  one suggested a heavy-set, stern-faced man, while the
other showed a man of more average build  &MD;  looked like the lanky
man with slight features, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Royster</ENAMEX>, who was finally arrested.
<p>
   ``In an instant, any of us can see anything,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth
Quinn</ENAMEX>, an aviation attorney and former chief counsel of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   To a degree, the media may be inspired to instant pronouncements
by government officials. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pena</ENAMEX> has made a practice of showing up at
crash sites and declaring within hours that the airline is safe.
<p>
   Although he didn't go to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash scene <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, he has
helped create an expectation  &MD;  despite the mantra of investigators
that they want the right answer, not a quick answer  &MD;  that
something definitive can be said soon after a crash.
<p>
   But as some crashes have shown, the appetite for a quick answer
cannot always be sated.
<p>
   In the case of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, there is an obvious difficulty in
figuring out if a bomb was aboard: Not only the black boxes that
record cockpit conversations and flight data but great chunks of
the fuselage had not been recovered three days after the crash.
They include the passenger and cargo areas most likely to have held
any bomb, and therefore most likely to show direct evidence of one.
<p>
   And in the more general run of accidents, so many technological
aircraft problems have been solved that crashes now typically
result from human error or the kind of subtle problems that never
completely go away.
<p>
   ``It's like having an ant bed in your back yard,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">William
Waldock</ENAMEX>, president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">System Safety Inc.</ENAMEX>, an aviation-safety
consulting firm in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Prescott</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX> ``You can put a hose on them,
but you don't get rid of them. You just move them.''
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> has not yet solved the mystery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> 737 crash
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX> that killed all 132 on board. That
accident was similar to another still unsolved crash, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United
Airlines</ENAMEX> 737 near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>. And since the shock
over these crashes settled, there has been little public clamoring
for preventive measures.
<p>
   The safety board, for example, recommended to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>
that airlines be required to install more advanced flight-data
recorders on all 737s by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1996</TIMEX>. That way, a mishap during
some future flight could be analyzed for clues that might finally
solve the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colorado Springs</ENAMEX> crashes, and prevent
others like them.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> initially balked at the recommendation, citing the cost
to the industry of such a modification. The agency then proposed a
more relaxed deadline for the change, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">within about four years</TIMEX>.
<p>
   When causes of crashes are eventually determined, aviation
experts say they are often handled too narrowly. A crash, for
example, may be blamed on pilot error, but that does little to
focus attention on the effectiveness of the training they received
and whether the cockpit should be modified to help prevent a
similar accident.
<p>
   The Last Link
<p>
   Crashes result from a chain of events, and pulling a link from
the chain early on can prevent the accident from occurring.
Aviation experts worry that there is often too much focus on the
last link.
<p>
   ``The important thing for air safety is, what can you do to
prevent the next accident,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">C.O. Miller</ENAMEX>, an aviation
consultant and former director of aviation safety for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``But the emphasis is on the cause, and the other things that
can be done are not being done.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> is one country that wants to buy advanced fighters. But
Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Fernando Rojas</ENAMEX>, commander of the Chilean air force, said that
he had stopped meeting with American aircraft manufacturers and
that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> was considering buying fighter planes from countries
that had no such restrictions.
<p>
   ``I rather like the North American planes, and I know the sales
brochures inside out,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> said in an interview. ``But until
they get permission from the government to sell them, I invite the
contractors to stop talking about planes and start taking tours in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>.''
<p>
   In the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last decade</TIMEX>, as military dictatorships proved to be
social and economic disasters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>, most countries have
made the transition to relatively stable democracies. The new
governments have greatly reduced military spending and liberalized
their economies.
<p>
   Except for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>, few countries in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin
America</ENAMEX> are building up their military resources or have the money
to buy the sophisticated weapons at issue. The weapons mentioned
most often are F-16 fighter-bombers, advanced helicopters and
electronics and radar systems.
<p>
   Many Latin American experts say the likelihood of military
conflict has been greatly reduced by economic integration. They
cite a rise in investments between countries and recent trade pacts
like Mercosur, which includes <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South America</ENAMEX>'s largest trading
partners: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paraguay</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Uruguay</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   But critics of the proposed change in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy note that the
Chilean military is still headed by Gen. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Augusto Pinochet</ENAMEX>, who led
the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1973</TIMEX> coup that toppled the leftist government of President
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Salvador Allende Gossens</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Under the Chilean constitution, which was written by <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pinochet</ENAMEX>,
the civilian government cannot cut military spending, and the armed
forces receive <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">10 percent</NUMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>'s copper sales, or up to <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$400
million</NUMEX> yearly.
<p>
   Military analysts said the sale of F-16s would change the air
power balance in favor of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>, which would have technology far
superior to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>'s, unless the Argentines also came up with
the money to buy F-16s.
<p>
   Defense Minister <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oscar Camilion</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX> said in a recent
interview that military spending by his country had declined <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">75
percent</NUMEX> in the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last 10 years</TIMEX>, and that it could not afford to buy
new F-16s.
<p>
   ``We think it would premature to sell F-16s in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX> at
this time,'' he said. ``We believe it would be very
unstabilizing.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>'s purchase of the advanced fighter planes would have
little impact on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX>, which is more than 10 times <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX>'s size.
<p>
   Although <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> has said it cannot afford to buy F-16s because
of budget cuts, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ivan Frota</ENAMEX>, a retired top general who often
comments on his country's military policy, said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Brazil</ENAMEX> would
probably find the money to buy F-16s, but only if they were fully
equipped with the latest technology.
<p>
   Some <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> congressmen who oppose removing the ban said its
withdrawal would prompt Latin American countries to plow scarce
resources into a costly arms race that would take money away from
much-needed social reforms.
<p>
   But <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> says it needs the F-16s to maintain a level of
competence and to defend itself against historic enemies.
<p>
   There is a persistent distrust in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> of its three neighbors  &MD; 
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Argentina</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bolivia</ENAMEX>  &MD;  which all have had major conflicts
with <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> in the past. This sentiment is partly promoted by the
armed forces in an effort to maintain support for a strong
military.
<p>
   ``We are not threatened by our neighbors,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rojas</ENAMEX> said. ``On the
contrary, we have excellent relations with them. But these
countries sometimes have goals that are counter to our interest. At
any given time it can come to a crisis.''
<p>
   Those opposed to changing <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> policy cite several events they
say illustrate the fragility of peace in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Latin America</ENAMEX>: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>'s
border war between <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Peru</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ecuador</ENAMEX>, which left 78 soldiers dead
and hundreds wounded; a standoff in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chile</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> between the
government and the armed forces over the imprisonment of convicted
military officers and an attempted military coup in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paraguay</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">April</TIMEX>.

TIPS, LEADS AND THEORIES ARE FLOODING IN

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">WASHINGTON</ENAMEX>  &MD;  With investigators still searching for evidence
that would show conclusively that the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 was
not an accident, federal authorities have been barraged with tips,
leads and theories about who or what may have downed the plane.
<p>
   While law-enforcement officials acknowledge that some theories
seem far-fetched, they are reluctant to rule out anything until
they learn more about the crash. Here are some of the most
provocative hypotheses:
<p>
   A WARNING IN <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LONDON</ENAMEX>: Seven hours before the explosion, an Arabic
daily newspaper in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">London</ENAMEX> received a fax from the radical Muslim
group the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Islamic Movement for Change</ENAMEX>, which in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">November 1995</TIMEX> took
responsibility for the bombing of an American military site in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Saudi Arabia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The fax referred elliptically to an imminent act of vengeance
against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>. One sentence said, ``The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Mujahedeen</ENAMEX> will
deliver the harshest reply to the threats of the foolish American
president. Everyone will be surprised by the volume, choice of
place and timing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Mujahedeen</ENAMEX> answer, and invaders must
prepare to depart alive or dead for their time is morning and
morning is near.''
<p>
   But officials who translated the Arabic said the references to
``morning'' were drawn from religious texts that probably referred
to an indefinite time in the future rather than the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>,
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   A MISSILE STRIKE: Several witnesses at the scene said they had
seen a bright point of light streaking across the sky seconds
before the plane disintegrated in two distinct bursts. Those
observations, along with an air traffic radar that picked up a
mysterious blip near the aircraft, led investigators to speculate
that a missile might have downed the aircraft.
<p>
   But experts have dismissed the blip as an electronic phantom
image. They said the jetliner, flying at 13,700 feet, was higher
than the maximum altitude of even the most sophisticated
shoulder-launched missiles. And they said no one had reported
seeing or hearing a missile launching.
<p>
   Even so, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> made a special appeal to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>
residents to report anything unusual they might have seen in the
sky the night of the crash.
<p>
   CLAIMS OF RESPONSIBILITY: Attorney General <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Janet Reno</ENAMEX> said after
the crash that two groups took responsibility for it, including one
calling itself a fundamentalist Islamic group that notified a
television station in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fla.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   Officials gave little credence to most such calls, saying that
they included no specific information about the crash and resembled
false declarations of responsibility that often follow a disaster.
They pointed out that some terrorists never publicly take
responsibility, probably fearing that it may lead to their arrest.
The Libyans accused of the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>
never took responsibility.
<p>
   Other declarations of responsibility have aroused greater
interest. For example, officials said they had received one from
professed followers of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Ahmed Yousef</ENAMEX>, who the authorities
suspect was the mastermind of the World Trade Center bombing in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX>. He is now on trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> for the bombing of a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Philippine Airlines</ENAMEX> 747 in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1994</TIMEX> that killed a Japanese
passenger and for a broad plot to blow up American airliners.
<p>
   The officials discounted the specific declaration of
responsibility, but did not rule out the possibility that someone
in <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX>'s loosely connected terrorist circle of Islamic,
anti-American veterans of the Afghan war against Soviet forces
might have played a part  &MD;  given their past record of terrorist
acts and known efforts to attack airliners.
<p>
   A LEBANESE TRAVELER: The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight that left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> had
originated in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Greece</ENAMEX>. Officials there reported that an
unidentified Lebanese man tried to board the flight but was refused
entry when his name turned up on a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> watch list
because he raised funds for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Hezbollah</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX> group
associated with past terrorist acts.
<p>
   The man presented airline representatives with a visa for travel
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> that was obtained in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sofia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bulgaria</ENAMEX>. The
presence of the man has not been fully explained. But
law-enforcement officials said it was unlikely that the man might
have been part of a terrorist operation because he did not arrive
at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> airport until after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight departed.
Officials said they also believe that his intended destination was
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   A BOMB: Investigators have weighed a multitude of competing
theories, from a catastrophic mechanical failure to the most
frequently mentioned possibility that someone concealed a powerful
bomb aboard the doomed jetliner.
<p>
   Reports suggest that a bomb may have been planted in luggage in
the plane's cargo bay, or in a cooler carrying transplantable
organs that was loaded on the flight in the last minutes before
Flight 800 took off. Investigators said that if a bomb caused the
crash, they cannot know how it was placed aboard until they recover
much more of the aircraft, like the cargo bay area and the cockpit
where biomedical items are usually carried.

   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert T. Francis 2nd</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of the five-member
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> who is leading the
investigation into the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800,
came to his <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$115,700</NUMEX>-a-year job in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">January 1995</TIMEX> after 20 years with
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In each major aviation accident, one of the five members takes
charge of the inquiry on a rotating basis.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> received his baptism of fire in connection with the
crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> Flight 592 in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>. At
that time, he broke with longstanding safety board procedures in
two respects: he held <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> news briefings in addition to the
customary nightly briefings and, more strikingly, he broke with the
tradition of saying absolutely nothing about the facts until
absolutely certain. But he said he was reserving the right to
correct his statements later.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>, who holds a commercial pilot's license, is a native of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> whose work as an administrative assistant to Rep.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gerry E. Studds</ENAMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Massachusetts</ENAMEX> Democrat, led him to a post as the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s congressional liaison. For much of his career with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> was in charge of the agency's office in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, overseeing
its activities in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Africa</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Middle East</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   During the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> investigation, when he grew annoyed when a
reporter persisted in repeating a question <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> believed he had
answered, he drew laughter by telling him in French, ``Perhaps I
can explain it to you.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> recused himself from the safety board's report on the
fatal <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> crash of a French-built <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> turboprop in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, on the grounds that his long experience in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>
and his connection to the French might be perceived as a conflict
of interest. The other four board members then issued a report
highly critical of the French manufacturer and French government
for failure to make clear the aircraft's vulnerability to ice.

<p>
   The dead do sometimes tell tales, if you know how to look for
them.
<p>
   Behind drawn shades in the autopsy rooms of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX>
medical examiner's office, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wetli</ENAMEX> and his team of 10
pathologists were looking for clues that could explain exactly how
the 230 passengers of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 died.
<p>
   The body of a person killed by a bomb looks different from the
body of a victim in an ``ordinary'' plane crash.
<p>
   The flesh of bomb victims is shredded and may be singed by
chemicals.
<p>
   But most of the corpses <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetli</ENAMEX> and his team examined had been
killed by the impact of hitting the water after falling from a
height of more than two miles  &MD;  a long (a minute and a half) and
terrible way to die.
<p>
   The mystery of their deaths will be solved  &MD;  in time.
<p>
   But it won't be easy, and it probably won't be quick.
<p>
   In the heavy swells off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> coast <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last
weekend</TIMEX>, a high-tech Pinger Locater System trolled the ocean bottom
looking for the all-important black boxes (which are actually
orange) that could reveal the last words of the pilots and final
instrument readings of the aircraft.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, another sonar found a trail of wreckage that may
lead divers to the plane's fuselage. And in a giant hangar at the
old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Grumman</ENAMEX> factory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Calverton</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, investigators
prepared to painstakingly reconstruct the shattered 747, bit by
bit.
<p>
   After a terrorist bomb downed <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>, officials were able to build a <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">90 percent</NUMEX>
complete ghost ship from fragments found over an 80-mile swath of
land. (A piece of plastic the size of a fingernail ultimately
fingered the attackers.)
<p>
   In the case of Flight 800, searchers must comb an area 500 miles
wide  &MD;  and 120 to 200 feet deep. As of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX>, they had
recovered <NUMEX TYPE="PERCENT">1 percent</NUMEX> of the plane.
<p>
   If a bomber is to blame, the death toll will be the highest ever
in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, worse even than the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oklahoma City</ENAMEX> blast that
claimed 168 lives.
<p>
   At this point, the possibilities are virtually endless: the
attack could have come from ideologically driven terrorists, a
disgruntled employee, a spurned lover, an insurance-scam artist.
It's still possible that a mechanical failure downed the plane.
<p>
   The manpower required for this investigation is huge: 400 <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">coast
guard</ENAMEX> sailors on nine ships and five aircraft; scores of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
agents; dozens of spooks and gumshoes from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Islip</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Islamabad</ENAMEX>.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEWSWEEK</ENAMEX> followed key officials and ordinary people caught in the
drama as it unfolded:
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Baur</ENAMEX>, an easygoing danger-lover, was piloting his HH-60
helicopter at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:40 p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last Wednesday</TIMEX> when an orange fireball
blossomed in the deep twilight. He saw two explosions and ``a
waterfall of flames'' spiraling down. His first thought was ``maybe
two planes had collided.''
<p>
   On a routine training run with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Air National Guard</ENAMEX>'s
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">106th Rescue Wing</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> swung his chopper south and throttled to
maximum power toward flames flaring 50 feet high.
<p>
   Peering through a gentle hail of glowing ashes, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> spotted a
young man in blue jeans and a T shirt floating face down amid the
debris. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> thought of turning over the controls to his copilot
and leaping into the sea.
<p>
   Just <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year before</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> had won a medal of valor for pulling
three fishermen out of the ocean off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nantucket</ENAMEX>; now he figured the
odds on another rescue.
<p>
   ``I thought, if he's alive, I could at least get his face out of
the water and keep him afloat,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Baur</ENAMEX> recalled. But the man was
limp and lifeless.
<p>
   ``I've got a body!'' shouted his flight engineer, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Dennis
Richardson</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">minutes later</TIMEX>. Actually, he had several ... then
several more ... then more than a score, clustered together in a
grotesque clump.
<p>
   The radio crackled with news from the tower: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> approach
had just lost a 747 from its radar screen. The crew of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air
National Guard</ENAMEX> chopper began dropping sea dye to mark the dead.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jim Cullen</ENAMEX>, the 53-year old vice president of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">King Kullen</ENAMEX>
grocery company, had just put his grandson to bed and settled down
to watch the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Yankee</ENAMEX> game. Then the bulletin flashed across the
screen that a jumbo jet had gone down 10 miles off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Moriches Inlet</ENAMEX>,
where <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX> lives.
<p>
   A neighbor, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike O'Reilly</ENAMEX>, called on the phone. ``Did you hear
about it?'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike</ENAMEX> asked. ``Let's go,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX> replied. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Reilly</ENAMEX>'s
speedboat, the Chasing Charlie, could do 55 mph. The wind was calm,
the seas light, the tide high.
<p>
   The sky was black and moonless, but the sea beyond the inlet was
suddenly alight  &MD;  with flames, flares, helicopter lights from an
impromptu armada of coast guardsmen, fishermen and good Samaritans.
The two <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">weekend</TIMEX> boaters headed flat out, eager to save someone.
<p>
   What they found, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX> said, was ``hell.'' ``There were legs
and internal parts floating around. It smelled like rot.'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX>
and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Reilly</ENAMEX> gingerly reached into an oil-slick swell to pull out a
woman's body. Her head fell off. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX> gasped; <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">O'Reilly</ENAMEX> felt sick.
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:30 a.m.</TIMEX> they limped home, their sleek fishing boat full of
bodies. ``How was it?'' asked <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cullen</ENAMEX>'s wife, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Linda</ENAMEX>. ``You don't
want to know,'' he answered.
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 a.m.</TIMEX>, hovering over the crash site in a state helicopter,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX> looked down and thought about the
families he would soon have to console. He found them in a small
ballroom at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="JFK">JFK airport</ENAMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Plaza Hotel</ENAMEX>. Some were huddled
in blankets.
<p>
   Bracing himself, he went from table to table, offering
sympathies. Some wept and hugged him. Some just stared vacantly.
Several begged to be allowed to travel to the scene. (A bad idea,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> had been warned by experts; the shock would just heighten
their grief.)
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> found a group of five families from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montoursville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>  &MD; 
the town had lost 21 people, a high-school French club going off on
a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> trip  &MD;  crying and asking why.
<p>
   The governor thought about his own 11-year-old daughter. He
broke down. No one would say the word, and as Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> knew,
he would be wrong to. But in his heart he knew that a bomber was to
blame.
<p>
   In moments of national crisis, bureaucracies need good traffic
cops. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> cabinet secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kitty Higgins</ENAMEX> felt the pager
vibrate against her waist while she was in the middle of a bridge
hand with a group of female lobbyists at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Republican Club</ENAMEX> on
Capitol Hill at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9:45</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   It was up to her to try to untangle the crisscrossing
jurisdictions and start the information flowing  &MD;  ``connecting up
the network,'' as she puts it. Among the pressing decisions to
make: whom to put out on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> network news shows?
<p>
   Normally, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation Department</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> take the lead in
plane crashes.
<p>
   But after seeing their hapless performances in the wake of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ValuJet</ENAMEX> disaster in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>, no one in the administration was anxious
to see <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Transportation</ENAMEX> Secretary <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Federico Pena</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> Administrator
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Hinson</ENAMEX> all over the tube again.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Higgins</ENAMEX> voted for another option: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast guard</ENAMEX> commandant Adm.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Kramek</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At the Secure Videoteleconference System (SVTS) room in the
basement of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT" MIN="West Wing">West Wing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX></ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government's
crisis command center, the product of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Feds</ENAMEX>' investigative
machinery began to trickle in at about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10:30 p.m.</TIMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">less than two
hours after Flight 800 had vanished from the radar screen</TIMEX>.
<p>
   From secure rooms throughout the bureaucracy  &MD;  the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Command
Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Justice</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Strategic Information
Operations Center</ENAMEX> at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>  &MD;  top officials, their agencies
identified by little cards beneath each video monitor along the
wall of the windowless 20-foot-by-40-foot room, briefed, quarreled
and jockeyed for position at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">2 a.m.</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m.</TIMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">10 a.m.</TIMEX> and at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4
p.m.</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">during the first 24 hours after the crash</TIMEX>.
<p>
   At the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4 p.m.</TIMEX> meeting on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, the SVTS room was so crowded
that the counterterrorism experts who had arrived early were bumped
from their seats to make way for President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s staff, who,
not uncustomarily, arrived late.
<p>
   Everyone was aware that careers, as well as the safety of
passengers, were at stake. Some officials are wary of SVTS
teleconferencing. They can't be sure which rival bureaucrats might
be hiding along the wall where the camera can't see them.
<p>
   In the SVTS room on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, most of the weary representatives
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">coast guard</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>, the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State Department</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Security Council</ENAMEX> staff shared
Governor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX>'s suspicions about terrorism.
<p>
   Yes, it was possible that the 25-year-old <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 had
self-destructed. But there had been no hint of mechanical troubles,
and controllers had reported no Mayday call from the cockpit.
<p>
   Ever since he had been summoned from a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Friar's Club</ENAMEX> dinner on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> (the dinner, a roast for former <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> police
commissioner <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Raymond Kelly</ENAMEX>, had broken up to the sound of beepers
going off all over the room), the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the chief
of the criminal investigation into the crash, had suspected foul
play.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kallstrom</ENAMEX> has a personal stake in the probe: he lost a friend in
the blast. But <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last week</TIMEX> he was careful not to jump to any
conclusions.
<p>
   Three weeks after the bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> troop barracks in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Dhahran</ENAMEX>
and two days before the lighting of the Olympic torch, there was no
shortage of potential suspects: Afghan fundamentalists, Bosnian
Serbs, Saudi extremists, drug cartels, American ideologues and any
deranged individual with a grudge against the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> or
one of the passengers.
<p>
   Counterterror experts began speculating about the followers of
Sheik <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdul Rahman</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ramzi Yousef</ENAMEX>, the alleged mastermind of the
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1993</TIMEX> World Trade Center bombing, who is now on trial in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
for plotting to blow up a dozen American 747s over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pacific</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1995</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Yousef</ENAMEX> favors <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Casio</ENAMEX> watches; prosecutors say he uses them to
make timing devices for his bombs.
<p>
   The initial talk in the SVTS room focused not on a bomb, but on
a missile. Some eyewitnesses thought they had seen something bright
arcing toward the jet just before it blew up.
<p>
   At the dawn SVTS conference on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> official
reported that a strange radar blip had crossed the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> craft as it
vanished from the screen. The massive engines of a 747, throttled
up to climb, would be magnets for a heat-seeking rocket.
<p>
   The prospect of terrorists launching a shoulder-fired missile at
a commercial airliner has haunted the intelligence community for
years. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CIA</ENAMEX> handed out hundreds of Stinger missiles to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">mujahedin</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Afghanistan</ENAMEX> during the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1980s</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Many were launched, as intended, at Soviet HIND helicopters. The
unsettling question was whether any of the rest fell into terrorist
hands  &MD;  a distinct possibility, given the fundamentalist zeal of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">muj</ENAMEX> and their migration to terrorist training camps in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lebanon</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bekaa Valley</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The Stinger theory resonated with the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, which had picked up
intelligence that some terrorists had been shopping for the lethal
weapons.
<p>
   As the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">6 a.m.</TIMEX> meeting got underway in the SVTS room, there was a
``lot of breathless talk'' about attacks by missiles, or MANPADS,
the acronym for Man Portable Air Defense Systems. (``A what?''
demanded a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> aide unfamiliar with military jargon.)
<p>
   Still, some experts were dubious. The Stingers handed out to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">muj</ENAMEX> are at least a decade old, and probably junk by now.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> cast further doubt on the Stinger theory with some
simple math. The effective range of a Stinger is just over two
miles, and its sensor can't lock on aircraft much above 11,000
feet. Flight 800 blew up 10 miles offshore at 13,700 feet.
<p>
   By the end of the meeting, some officials were wondering whether
the radar blip was a model rocket. And at air-traffic control on
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> officials reviewing radar tapes were unable to
find even the mysterious blip.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>, debate in the SVTS room turned back to the
possibility of a bomb stowed on board. The obvious model was the
terrorist downing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103. That flight had been blown
up by a barometric device,set to detonate when the plane reached a
certain altitude.
<p>
   The bomb had been planted on the plane at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Frankfurt</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Germany</ENAMEX>, airport, then known for its porous security. Safeguards in
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> airport, where <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 800 originated, were worse. There is
oone other critical difference: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 blew up over land, where
the parts could be quickly recovered.
<p>
   Flight 800 had vanished into more than 100 feet of water. Still,
it might have been worse. At <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JFK</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> jet was delayed about an
hour. Had the plane been on time and in the air for another hour
before a time bomb detonated, the plane might have gone down into
water 1,000 feet deep.
<p>
   There were no obvious bomb clues in the first few hours and
days. Officials reported that there had been a ``full bag match''
at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JFK</ENAMEX> as Flight 800 was loaded and boarded, meaning that all
checked and carry-on luggage had matched passenger IDs.
<p>
   But it was possible that a suicide bomber had checked a bag full
of plastic explosives; the baggage X-ray machines at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JFK</ENAMEX> are
designed to spot metal weapons.
<p>
   Only two airports in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San
Francisco</ENAMEX>) have the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">million-dollar</NUMEX> high-tech scanners that can
detect the kind of synthetic explosives that terrorists now
routinely use. It was also possible that a member of the ground
crew had slipped a bomb onto the plane.
<p>
   It takes about 50 people to ``turn around'' a jet on the ground
 &MD;  to check, fuel, provision and load. By <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
agents were devouring passenger manifests and interviewing the
airline's maintenance crews.
<p>
   None of the passengers' names turned up in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">State
Department</ENAMEX>'s database of 30,000 known or suspected terrorists or
felons. Of course, that doesn't rule out the use of false IDs.
<p>
   Could a bomb have been planted in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>, before the plane had
even reached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">JFK</ENAMEX>? ``We have the feeling that nothing much can have
happened here,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX> airport security manager <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Takis
Tassopoulous</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Infamous as a target (the first-ever airport terrorist attack in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1968</TIMEX>, the first attempted handheld-missile assault on an aircraft,
the most hijackings except for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beirut</ENAMEX>), <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hellinikon Airport</ENAMEX> now has
armored cars in front of the passenger lounge and on the tarmac.
<p>
   But as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEWSWEEK</ENAMEX>'S reporter hung around on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, he watched
the policeman guarding the entrance to the runway wander off to
talk to an acquaintance. The door was left wide open.
<p>
   Five thousand miles away, in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>, Mayor <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Campbell</ENAMEX> was
wondering about his own airport. On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX>, as he sped down
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Interstate 75</ENAMEX> in his black Lincoln Town Car to greet <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>, who
was arriving for the lighting of the Olympic flame, the mayor
wrestled with a dilemma.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">That very night</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> would open to the world. Three million
people from 197 countries had come to ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">The City Too Busy to Hate</ENAMEX>''
to share the fellowship of sport. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> was damned if he was
going to turn <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Hartsfield">Hartsfield airport</ENAMEX> into a gated fortress.
<p>
   The airport had been at what the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> calls ``Level Three''
security since <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last summer</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> didn't want to go to Level
Four, which would allow only ticketed passengers into the main
terminal and keep cars far from the curb.
<p>
   The result would be more than inhospitable; it would be chaos.
``I think, ultimately, you cannot be a prisoner or held hostage to
the specter of terrorism,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Campbell</ENAMEX> told <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEWSWEEK</ENAMEX>. ``Our greatest
strength is our openness.'' But openness, the mayor conceded, is
also <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX>'s greatest weakness.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">MORICHES</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  After the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">December 1988</TIMEX>, it took investigators seven days to
determine that the cause was a bomb.
<p>
   But after a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 crashed on approach to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX> in
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">September 1994</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> spent weeks trying to determine if someone
sabotaged the plane to kill a passenger who was a federal drug
informer. But that theory proved wrong, and the cause of that crash
is still not certain, though a mechanical problem is suspected.
<p>
   The crucial evidence needed to get a good idea of what caused a
crash differs from accident to accident, and so does the time
needed to find it. Sometimes, investigators come up with the
answers in two or three days  &MD;  other times, never.
<p>
   The problem with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800, investigators say, is that the
best evidence usually found in plane parts that do not float, and
that because of weather, they have not raised anything from the
bottom since the crash on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The water, though, is quite shallow by salvage standards, only
about 140 feet at the deepest. Often, flight data recorders and
other aircraft parts from other crashes have been retrieved from
thousands of feet of water. And four days is not a very long time
by most crash-investigation standards. Some crash investigations
have gone much faster, but others have taken much longer, even when
the plane crashed on land.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> 757 headed to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cali</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Colombia</ENAMEX>, from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>
crashed on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 20, 1995</TIMEX>, and searchers found the
``black boxes'' <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two days later</TIMEX>. Shortly after, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> read out the data, and it was obvious
to investigators that the cause was human error.
<p>
   The investigation into the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> DC-9 crash in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>
on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX> took a little longer, and for <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">several days</TIMEX>, a bomb was
among the theories. There were three crucial clues in the crash:
the co-pilot's radio transmission about smoke in the cockpit, along
with shipping records that never left the ground about oxygen
generators put improperly in the forward cargo hold, and an
indication on the flight recorder of a sudden, brief increase in
cabin pressure.
<p>
   The crash was at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">midday</TIMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 11</TIMEX>, and discovery of the
conclusive piece of evidence was announced by the safety board on
the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX> of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May 14</TIMEX>, a day after the flight data recorder was
found in the mud of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Everglades</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The crash in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Roselawn</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ind.</ENAMEX>, of an ATR-72 turboprop operated by
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Eagle</ENAMEX> was resolved almost as rapidly. It went down in a
bean field on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Oct. 31, 1994</TIMEX>, and the flight data and voice
recorders  &MD;  the ``black boxes''  &MD;  were found in the mud on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 2</TIMEX>.
<p>
   By the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next day</TIMEX>, investigators had a detailed picture of the
plane's trajectory, and by <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Nov. 4</TIMEX> they very strongly suspected the
problem was related to icing in flight. A full public explanation
did not appear until hearings held <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">four months later</TIMEX>, and a formal
declaration of the cause did not come until <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier this month</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Only twice in recent years has the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> taken over an
investigation because of a finding that the cause was criminal, and
both conclusions came quickly.
<p>
   When a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Southwest</ENAMEX> plane crashed on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Dec. 7, 1987</TIMEX>, with 43
people on board, the pilot said in a transmission shortly before
the crash of his small commuter jet that there had been gunfire in
the cabin. There were no survivors. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Two days later</TIMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> found
the pistol, and soon after, a note written on an air-sickness bag
by a disgruntled former airline employee that explained why he was
about to shoot the two pilots.
<p>
   Early on, investigators thought the former employee had also had
a bomb, but later, they decided that he did not and that the cause
of the crash was the killing of both pilots.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Last October</TIMEX>, when <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX>'s Sunset Limited, en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los
Angeles</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, derailed near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hyder</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ariz.</ENAMEX>, investigators
decided almost immediately that it was sabotage because they found
a rail with missing bolts. They also found a note claiming
responsibility. Despite those initial leads, the case is still
unsolved.

<TEXT>
<p>
   After years of fretting and poring over self-help manuals marked
down to half-price, I've decided the only sane response to modern
times is panic disorder.
<p>
   It's the perfect catchall remedy for life's traumas and random
insults, such as turning on the tube expecting a juicy sitcom and
instead being treated to a documentary on the Freon crisis.
<p>
   Not to make light of other people's troubles, we all have to
come to terms with chance events that can't possibly be explained,
except by a 10-second sound bite. What can be more upsetting than
seeing the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Publisher's Clearinghouse</ENAMEX> van slowly crusing down the
street, then pulling into the driveway two houses away? How can
fate be so cruel?
<p>
   There are so many ways in which we are put to the test and found
wanting:
<p>
    &MD;  Opening the utility bill and seeing a number that closely
resembles the area code for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Diego</ENAMEX>.
<p>
    &MD;  Consulting the Weather Channel, laboriously sweeping the pool
and getting to enjoy your handiwork for a few seconds before a dust
storm blows in straight off the set of Lawrence of Arabia.
<p>
    &MD;  Daring to make a solo visit to the department store perfume
counter, getting spritzed, purchasing an ounce of a chic fragrance
without asking the price, and then watching the wife spill half the
contents down the sink.
<p>
   The socially accepted way to cope is panic disorder. It may not
be covered under everyone's deductible, and it may be void where
prohibited by law, but it's definitely a trendy way of handling
life's curveballs and knockdown pitches.
<p>
   Once you experience panic disorder and learn to roll with it,
you never have to fear intruders of the pesky dinner-hour variety,
pitching you a new home security system.
<p>
   As you will learn as a veteran of panic disorder, the most
sophisticated home security system is no good if it doesn't make
you feel secure.
<p>
   My thinking goes like this: <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX>, carpet cleaning. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Today</TIMEX>,
in-home security. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tomorrow</TIMEX>, dual-pane windows. Who needs it? Let me
just eat dinner in peace, without the phone ringing.
<p>
   Besides, we already have a pretty sophisticated security system,
the TROY. Requires no knowledge of electronics. Doesn't come with a
300-page technical manual. Never needs to be programmed. And it's
about as reliable as some other systems, which is to say, it works
when it works.
<p>
   Actually, Troy is a not-so-vicious attack dog, a 15-pound Lhasa
apso, a little fur ball that barks when the doorbell rings, but
lets the yardman enter the gate without a whimper. The descendant
of canines that once protected Tibetan temples, Troy fetches his
squeaker toy when the pest control person enters the front door.
Some warning system.
<p>
   All this is a way of working up to a serious point, which is,
how to deal with the awful, horrific, nightmare-inducing events
like the midair explosion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800.
<p>
   There is a familiar ritual for coming to terms with these
frightful disasters, beginning with eyewitness accounts, searchers
recovering the flight recorder, investigators piecing together
remnants of the aircraft, and finally, months later, some
transportation expert offering an incomprehensible jumble of words
to explain away the unexplainable. The whole bit is comforting, if
only in being so familiar. An uneasy faith is restored that lasts
until the next time.
<p>
   Panic disorder is another line of defense, and it requires no
formal training. Being around a while is about all it takes. There
is so much uncertainty in our everyday lives, panic disorder is
almost second-nature.
<p>
   Think of all the calamities <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">over the last 20 years</TIMEX>: <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Three Mile
Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Chernobyl</ENAMEX>, AIDS, the Challenger explosion, the stock market
crash, train derailments, assassinations, famines, droughts,
floods, fires. No wonder one of the most quoted sayings of this or
any decade is, ``If you want to make God laugh, tell him your
plans.''
<p>
   Despite the urge to panic, we tend to resent any disruptions
that might provide a little protection. In the wake of terrorist
bombings, security is stepped up at airports and public facilities.
In a few days, however, complaints outweigh fears.
<p>
   Elaborate security precautions are in force at the Olympics in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX>. I remember how it was in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>: each time
you entered an arena, or venue, your bag or satchel was searched.
Nobody got blown up or shot, but I thought somebody would get
stomped by impatient people waiting in line. Much the same thing
happened at the Super Bowl in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Tampa</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">five years ago</TIMEX>, the experience
heightened by the sight of SWAT teams positioned atop the press
box.
<p>
   The logical conclusion would be that there is no such thing as a
sure thing. Except that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Barkley</ENAMEX> will come up with something
to say in the next few days that will leave everybody thinking,
``He can't get away with that, can he?''

<p>
   ABOARD THE DRIFTMASTER  &MD;  Less than an hour into the sixth day of
their search for floating wreckage or human remains from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans
World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800, the eight-person crew on this 285-ton
ship made a sighting.
<p>
   ``Flip-flop to starboard,'' said Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard Gaudreau</ENAMEX>. Two men
hustled to the bow with a long-handled net as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaudreau</ENAMEX> maneuvered
the 100-foot vessel alongside a small object in the water.
<p>
   ``Not exactly what you would wear on a flight to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>,'' said
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel Florio</ENAMEX>, one of the boat's mates, as he plucked a 10-inch
sandal from the water. ``Probably from the beach.'' One more false
alarm.
<p>
   For nearly a week, this <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX> vessel  &MD;  one in
a flotilla of craft from an assortment of agencies  &MD;  has been
searching hundreds of square miles of the surface of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX> south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, for vestiges of the jumbo jet and
its 230 occupants.
<p>
   The days when the water was acrid with jet fuel have passed, and
most recent sightings have been unrelated to the crash, turning out
to be tossed coffee cups, plastic bags, beachwear and even a
yard-long sea turtle.
<p>
   But occasionally the crew snares grim evidence of the disaster.
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">evening</TIMEX>, it steamed to the edge of the ``exclusion zone''
around the crash site and transferred to a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> boat a brown
trash bag containing the latest fragments, including a swatch of
padded, metallic material and the floatable cushion from an
aircraft seat.
<p>
   No matter how small, each find could provide clues to the cause
of the crash, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaudreau</ENAMEX> said. For the crew of the Driftmaster  &MD; 
whose normal job is scouring garbage and driftwood from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>
harbor  &MD;  each day has been a numbing and occasionally rewarding
routine of sweeping back and forth and giving a second look to
every odd reflection in the water.
<p>
   While the search for sunken wreckage has been aided by
sophisticated sonar and robot equipment, the quest for floating
debris has been made mainly by squinting human eyes.
<p>
   Lookouts on the flying bridge and bow scour the sea, each in his
or her own way. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Elizabeth Finn</ENAMEX>, a nine-year veteran of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps of
Engineers</ENAMEX>, intently peered at the horizon from the bow just 10 feet
or so above the waves.
<p>
   ``When you are low, you see more water and less sky,'' Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX>
said. ``It's also quiet up here.''
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaudreau</ENAMEX> got the news that they might be stationed
here for at least another week. Reports were circulating that a
large piece of the fuselage would be raised soon, most likely
causing many new items to pop to the surface.
<p>
   The 48-year-old ship, one of several vessels used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Corps
of Engineers</ENAMEX> to collect harbor debris and sunken objects, is ideal
for collecting this flotsam, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Gaudreau</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``We've been called for just about anything,'' he said, ticking
off a list of objects retrieved around <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> harbor, including
helicopters, automobiles and a dead 45-foot whale that was carried
on the bow of a ship into <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Port Newark</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.J.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX> signaled a sighting with a loud yell and an
outstretched arm, indicating a heading for the helmsman. False
alarm.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX>, Ms. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Finn</ENAMEX> had had better luck, when she spotted a
seat cushion bobbing in a glassy calm. The cushion was floating
upside down, she said, revealing the white label on the bottom with
the instructions ``hold straps.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Frederick Tang</ENAMEX>, a deckhand, had examined the cushion. ``It's
pretty weird to think that someone was sitting in that,'' he said.
<p>
   As long as he was concentrating on the work, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Tang</ENAMEX> said, he felt
all right about the search.
<p>
   ``But when you stop for a while and think of what the pieces are
from, it's really unsettling,'' he added.
<p>
   The crew, often given to boisterous joking, was most somber on
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>, he and others said. In the middle of a field of debris they
found a child-sized sneaker and an unopened candy bar.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">This afternoon</TIMEX>, the marine radio squawked with a new flurry of
messages between <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> vessels. A fishing boat 30
miles offshore had found two pieces of wreckage.
<p>
   ``Please stay put,' a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> operator said. ``But don't
touch anything.''
<p>
   Then, just before the radio was switched to a scrambled
frequency, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> vessel reported that two more bodies had been
found, including one of a child about 5 years old.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Branigan</ENAMEX>, the assistant chief engineer on the Driftmaster,
said the search was particularly unsettling for him because his
16-year old daughter, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heather</ENAMEX>, had taken the same <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 1</TIMEX> with 34 classmates from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">St Joseph's Hill Academy</ENAMEX> on
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Staten Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>
<p>
   ``I really feel for the people who lost kids out here,'' he
said.

BOMB THEORY STRENGTHENS IN <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> PROBE

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  One week after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 exploded over the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX>, federal investigators are growing more convinced
that the jumbo jet was downed by a terrorist bomb.
<p>
   Direct evidence is still inconclusive, but one source familiar
with the investigation said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> &UR; : &LR;  ``We just cannot envision
any other event that gives us the same scenario.''
<p>
   This tentative conclusion was also presented on Capitol Hill
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, as officials from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> briefed lawmakers on the disaster.
<p>
   Officials say the growing suspicion stems from several factors,
including the safety record of the 747 and the lack of a distress
call from the crew.
<p>
   But some even more compelling reasons are new  &MD;  including
physical evidence of aircraft fragments and a second-by-second
analysis of air-traffic controllers' radar tapes.
<p>
   ``It appears more and more likely that it is an onboard
explosion,'' said one official who attended the congressional
briefings. ``They dismissed some of the other theories,'' such as a
missile fired from a boat or a catastrophic mechanical failure.
<p>
   President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> was briefed <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> by
all the federal agencies involved in the investigation.
<p>
   In an attempt to avoid the kind of situation that occurred
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> when <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George Pataki</ENAMEX> said more bodies had
been discovered  &MD;  only to have investigators disavow that assertion
 &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX> agreed to help set up a direct communications link between
the families and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> ships searching the ocean floor for more
bodies and debris.
<p>
   Many relatives were so outraged by the inaccurate information
that they held a <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late-night</TIMEX> news conference to criticize <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pataki</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The governor met with frustrated relatives at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Ramada Inn</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> in an attempt to allay their anger over the conflicting
information of the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night before</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The new communications link will allow the relatives to be
informed the moment more bodies have been recovered, without having
to wait for the nightly news briefings.
<p>
   Divers recovered three more bodies <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, bringing the total
to 113, nearly half of the 230 people who were killed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert
Bontempi</ENAMEX> of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> Medical Examiner's office said 95 of
those bodies have been identified. There are 12 tentative
identifications.
<p>
   Ninety-four families have been notified and 72 bodies have been
returned to families. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bontempi</ENAMEX> said 19 of the victims' families
have not provided any information  &MD;  such as dental records, photos
or fingerprints  &MD;  that would help in the identification process.
<p>
   Federal sources, who asked not to be identified, disclosed new
information <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX> that points to a bomb as the source of the
explosion on the plane, which had just taken off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy
airport</ENAMEX> on its way to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The last transmission air-traffic controllers received from the
pilot was a response the crew was complying with a request to climb
from 13,000 feet to 15,000 feet.
<p>
   Radar tracked the plane at 13,700 feet at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30 p.m.</TIMEX>, updating
the plane's position every 12 seconds. At the next radar sweep, the
plane was still there but the plane's transponder  &MD;  which signals
the flight identification to controllers  &MD;  was no longer
transmitting. Sources said that indicated a catastrophic electrical
failure.
<p>
   Less than <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">two minutes later</TIMEX>, the plane had broken into at least
two pieces. <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">Twelve seconds after that</TIMEX>, it had disintegrated  &MD;  seen
on the radar screen as ``a whole bunch of little plus signs,''
according to a source who reviewed the tape.
<p>
   With at least four people in the cockpit, investigators believe
that at least one of the crew should have been able to send a
distress signal. Though the two pilots may have been struggling to
control the plane, either one of them  &MD;  by pressing a button on
their handset  &MD;  could have shouted ``Mayday'' through the
microphones they should have been wearing. One of the two flight
engineers could have sent a call almost as easily.
<p>
   Investigators believe the plane exploded at an altitude of less
than 9,000 feet, based on interviews with pilots in the area. This
means it would have descended nearly 5,000 feet in a minute  &MD;  fast
but entirely possible, sources said.
<p>
   Catastrophic engine failure might be consistent with this data.
<p>
   But in a 747, the engines are forward of the fuel, which is
stored in the wings. If there was a failure, engine parts could
have entered the fuselage and caused decompression, but there
should not be the electrical failure and there should have been a
distress call.
<p>
   The crew should be able to use the radio until the airplane
starts to break up, a source said.
<p>
   The fact that, under these circumstances, an electrical failure
did take place and the crew could not use the radio, further
supports the idea of a cataclysmic explosion from a bomb, the
official said.
<p>
   Furthermore, another official, who attended the congressional
briefing said an analysis of fragments recovered from the plane
display certain markings consistent with a bomb exploding inside
the plane.
<p>
   However, those conducting the briefing said that their theory
will not be conclusive until chemical traces of an explosion are
detected. The FBI crime lab is still conducting tests; no such
residues have as yet been found.
<p>
   Sonar equipment and divers onboard the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> salvage ship USS
Grasp got a clearer view of a 2-square-mile ``debris field''
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>, including a 45-foot-high chunk of what may be the
fuselage. That chunk could contain not only the telltale signs of
an explosion but many more bodies as well.

<p>
   What was to become the second-worst aviation disaster in
American history started like any other busy <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> at
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">John F. Kennedy International Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At the terminals, there was a swirl of activity with passengers
arriving in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> as thousands more  &MD;  some rushing to their
gates  &MD;  departed to the corners of the earth.
<p>
   Amid the hubbub were 230 people heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> for fun, to go
home for love, for education, for work. The following, based on
interviews with well-placed sources at the airport, the airline and
those investigating the explosion, is an account of <TIMEX TYPE="TIME" STATUS="OPT">the last few
hours</TIMEX> of the plane.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 881 touched down at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">4:38 p.m.</TIMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX> of
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>, more than an hour late on the scheduled nine-hour flight
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Athens</ENAMEX>. The 349 passengers and crew got off the 747, which had
developed problems with the exhaust pressure gauge in the No. 3
engine.
<p>
   It was not an unusual problem for the 25-year-old jet, and <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
mechanics fixed it. But it meant that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> employees were losing the
daily struggle of trying to get hundreds of people  &MD;  in this case
ranging from an 11-year-old girl traveling alone to a couple
celebrating an 80th birthday  &MD;  onto the plane so it could push back
from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Gate 27</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 p.m.</TIMEX>, the scheduled departure time for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight
800.
<p>
   Because the plane had arrived late, cleaning crews quickly went
through the cabin. They emptied trash bins in the lavatories,
refolded blankets and plumped pillows before storing them in
overhead bins.
<p>
   Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Steven Snyder</ENAMEX>, 57, who reviews the piloting skills of his
colleagues, had made the trip from his home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Stratford</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, to
the airport to do a line check on Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ralph G. Kevorkian</ENAMEX>, 58 &UR; . &LR; 
<p>
   Together, the two men had more than 35,000 hours of flying, a
remarkable confluence of experience.
<p>
   Also in the cockpit, high above the main passenger deck, flight
engineer <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard G. Campbell</ENAMEX>, 63, of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ridgefield</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Conn.</ENAMEX>, was showing
the ropes to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Oliver Krick</ENAMEX>, a 25-year-old flight engineer in
training who lived outside <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">St. Louis</ENAMEX>, the hub of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> operations.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Pam Lychner</ENAMEX>, a former <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight attendant, was using a perk as
a former employee to take her two daughters, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Shannon</ENAMEX>, 10, and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Katie</ENAMEX>, 8, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> for an education-filled trip. The <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lychners</ENAMEX>, like
14 others, were non-paying standbys with a connection to the
airline  &MD;  able to hitch a ride if the flight was not full.
<p>
   It wasn't, so ticket agents let them all go down the jetway onto
the plane.
<p>
   On the tarmac, the plane was being filled with more than 48,000
gallons of fuel for the trans-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> flight, and bags, suitcases,
backpacks and packages were loaded into the cargo holds, forward
and aft of the huge wings &UR; . &LR; 
<p>
   Shortly before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 p.m.</TIMEX>, Flight 800 was delayed when a
baggage-check scan of one bag did not match with the passenger
manifest. The bag was taken off the plane, but then the
unidentified passenger arrived. The bag was placed on board again.
<p>
   Then, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7:30</TIMEX>, ramp workers tried to start the baggage
conveyor-belt truck, but the engine would not turn over. &UR;  &LR; Shortly
before <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 p.m.</TIMEX>, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> tow truck finally pulled away the crippled
piece of equipment.
<p>
   With 433 seats on the plane for the 230 passengers, some of the
seasoned travelers likely looked for spare seats where they could
stretch out and sleep during the seven-hour flight.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jacques Charbonnier</ENAMEX>, the 66-year-old flight service manager, had
welcomed the passengers on board and announced over the speaker
that the movie ``The Birdcage'' would be shown after dinner. The
headphones already had been passed out by some of the 14 flight
attendants. In first class, passengers were greeted with <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Mumm</ENAMEX>'s
champagne in plastic cups. The glass flutes and china would come
out after the plane was airborne.
<p>
   In the vast coach section, 16 high school French students from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Montoursville</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pa.</ENAMEX>, giddy about their <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX> trip after two years of
bake sales and car washes to pay for it, settled into their seats.
Some of them, leafing through the in-flight magazine, probably
skipped past the classical channel offering <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Sibelius</ENAMEX>' violin
concerto in D minor to hear ``The Top in Pop'' on Channel 5,
offering the sounds of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Gin Blossoms</ENAMEX> and <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Celine Dion</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On the international flight between two cosmopolitan cities were
the rich and famous, but there was also <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Larkie Dwyer</ENAMEX>, 11, from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Arizona</ENAMEX>, who sat alone. She was traveling to visit relatives in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth and Edwin Brooks</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edgartown</ENAMEX> were seated together.
The trip was to celebrate <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" MIN="80th birthday">her 80th birthday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:02 p.m.</TIMEX>, the plane was pushed back from the gate.
<p>
   On the flight deck, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kevorkian</ENAMEX> started up the four engines. After
checking with air traffic controllers in the tower overlooking the
sprawling airport, the plane began its taxi to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">Runway 22R</ENAMEX> &UR; . &LR; 
<p>
   Around <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:15</TIMEX> the plane was cleared onto the 11,351-foot-long
runway. Some nervous passengers may have given a final pull to
tighten their seat belts. As the plane began its takeoff roll, a
cockpit crew member called out the steadily increasing speed. ``50
... 60 ... 70 ... .'' Then came the call ``V-1,'' the point when
the plane cannot stop before the end of the runway. Then came
``V-R'' for velocity rotation, the point when the nose wheel begins
to lift off the ground, and finally ``V-2,'' the minimum safe
flying speed, probably more than 160 m.p.h.
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:19</TIMEX>, Flight 800 was in the air, the wheels in the well.
After a short climb over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jamaica Bay</ENAMEX>, the jumbo jet began a
sweeping turn to the left, over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Rockaway Park</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX> beyond.
<p>
   It was a beautiful <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> for flying. Temperatures were in the
70s. It was partly cloudy, but visibility was unrestricted.
<p>
   The flight plan was a staple of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Europe</ENAMEX> route.
Pilots and controllers call it the ``Bette One departure'' from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Fly to a specific longitude and latitude in the ocean known as
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bette</ENAMEX>, and draw a bead on the navigational aids on <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nantucket</ENAMEX>. From
there, the plane was to turn left again, heading north to another
specific fix, known as ``<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bradd</ENAMEX>'' in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Gulf of Maine</ENAMEX>, about 60
miles south of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Yarmouth</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nova Scotia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Heavy with fuel, the plane continued its slow, steady climb,
toward a cruising altitude of seven miles up.
<p>
   More than 150 miles away, at the air route traffic control
center, known as the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Boston Center</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nashua</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.H.</ENAMEX>, two controllers
were working the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sardi</ENAMEX> sector  &MD;  a busy slice of air that handles
traffic to the east of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy</ENAMEX>. It is common practice for two
controllers to work the same radar scope at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Boston Center</ENAMEX>  &MD;  one
controller talking with the plane, the other with other
controllers.
<p>
   They received Flight 800 from the controllers at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:25 p.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   There was no sign of trouble as <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Boston Center</ENAMEX> controllers
routinely told the crew to climb to 15,000 feet.
<p>
   As usual, the pilot responded by repeating the instructions at
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:30</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``TW 800 heavy, out of one-three for one-five,'' referring to
13,000 feet and 15,000 feet. It was the flight crew's last
communication.
<p>
   On board, passengers sitting on the left side of the airplane
had a fabulous view of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>. With the sun setting at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:24</TIMEX>,
the string of white lights helped outline the graceful sweep of
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Jones Beach</ENAMEX> and the south coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   In the galleys, flight attendants may have been getting the
drink carts out of their stowed position, getting ready to offer
cocktails to passengers. Then would come dinner: In coach, there
was a choice of beef <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mediterranean</ENAMEX> with carrots and cavatelli in a
butter sauce or roast turkey with sage and onion stuffing, mashed
turnips and mixed vegetables. In first class, the options included
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Maine</ENAMEX> lobster or beef tenderloin.
<p>
   Suddenly, something rocked the plane when it was at 13,700 feet.
Investigators believe the event knocked out electrical power
because the plane's transponder stopped working and there was no
distress call.
<p>
   Over the next 50 seconds or so, the plane dropped a mile, and
when it was below 9,000 feet, according to investigators, it
exploded. Burning jet fuel lighted the gathering darkness.
<p>
   The radar used by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Boston Center</ENAMEX> make sweeps every 12
seconds, updating the positions of the aircraft being monitored.
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 appeared on the screen with a sweep of the radar
located in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Truro</ENAMEX> at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:31</TIMEX>. At the next sweep  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">12 seconds
later</TIMEX>  &MD;  the blip of the plane was there but the altitude was gone.
<p>
   A review of the tape shows the blip was still there at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:31 and
33 seconds</TIMEX> and again at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:31 and 45 seconds</TIMEX>. At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:31 and 57
seconds</TIMEX>, the readout shows ``two primary hits''  &MD;  or blips  &MD;  along
the flight path of Flight 800, an indication the plane was breaking
apart.
<p>
   The next sweep, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8:32 and nine seconds</TIMEX>, shows ``a whole bunch
of little plus signs''  &MD;  the massive disintegration of an airplane
slowly spreading out in a two-mile-wide fan across the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   The divers call it <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mako City</ENAMEX>, after the medium-size sharks that
prowl there.
<p>
   In a seabed 130 feet beneath the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic</ENAMEX> nine miles off the
coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, small whales, sea turtles and
sharks meander around a maze of thick wire cables and shards of
jagged metal.
<p>
   It is forever twilight in the graveyard of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800; a
diver swimming into the stygian gloom risks becoming entangled in
the debris, or slicing an air hose, or coming face to face with a
hammerhead. Or a corpse.
<p>
   Hardly an ideal working environment: entering it, one diver told
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Washington Post</ENAMEX>, was like being ``lowered into hell.''
<p>
   Yet out of this gloom must come answers, and none too soon.
<p>
   The victims' families, who are understandably beginning to sound
more like hostages than like mourners, are demanding the bodies of
their loved ones.
<p>
   The gumshoes, on the other hand, want evidence that may lead
them to a possible bomber, even if that means disturbing the watery
graves of the dead.
<p>
   Politicians and reporters want headlines, sometimes before they
have the facts to back them up. The result of all this clamor and
conflict has been to confuse a public made even edgier by the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlanta</ENAMEX> bombing.
<p>
   In addition to all its other cultures, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">America</ENAMEX> now has a culture
of disaster. Hardened cops, grieving widows, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">CNN</ENAMEX> cameramen and
grasping pols are all trapped in it together.
<p>
   The images are familiar: the weary bureaucrats giving guarded
nonanswers to edgy reporters, the shellshocked searchers returning
from the grisly scene, the angry families tired of being given the
runaround. It is hard for everyone, particularly the families.
<p>
   But it requires special patience from the investigators, both
the safety experts and the cops, who know the lessons of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>
and other major air disasters: that getting the truth takes time  &MD; 
months and years  &MD;  and that answers rarely fall neatly into news
cycles, especially if the most important clues lie 20 fathoms
beneath the sea.
<p>
   Top investigation officials described their thought processes to
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NEWSWEEK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  and explained why it's a mistake to jump to conclusions.
<p>
   Titillating reports on the crash keep coming, only to be knocked
down. Network news said several victims had shrapnel wounds that
might be suffered in a bomb blast. But investigators had to point
out that any crash this catastrophic could leave plane fragments in
the victims' bodies.
<p>
   Other reports suggested that explosive residue had been found on
fragments of Flight 800. Not yet, cautioned the Feds, though
massive salvage ships will continue to fish for key parts,
including the plane's engines, from the ``debris field'' beneath
the waves.
<p>
   More concrete was the evidence from Flight 800's black boxes,
the tape recorders of cockpit conversations and instrument readings
recovered by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navy</ENAMEX> divers from the ocean floor. Flight 800's tape
ends with a very brief, loud noise.
<p>
   Had the plane suffered a catastrophic mechanical failure, the
747's recorders would probably have picked up telltale instrument
readings, not to mention the anguished last words of the pilots.
<p>
   After reviewing radar tapes and interviewing witnesses, mostly
pilots from planes flying near Flight 800 when it went down,
investigators have reconstructed a picture of the plane's last
moments.
<p>
   It appears that an initial explosion of some kind sent the plane
plummeting from an altitude of 13,700 feet.
<p>
   After about 20 seconds  &MD;  sheer terror for the passengers, most
of whom were probably still alive  &MD;  the whole plane burst into
flames, most likely when the aviation fuel caught fire. (A jumbo
jet crossing the ocean carries about 47,000 gallons of fuel, which
is stored in the wings.)
<p>
   The fuselage plunged an additional 9,000 feet into the sea,
crashing about 40 seconds after the first explosion. A shower of
debris kept floating through the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">twilight</TIMEX> sky for as long as 15
minutes.
<p>
   Such evidence may be enough to make investigators say publicly
what they believe privately, that a bomb took down the jumbo jet.
But they still weren't ready to rule out all other theories,
including the possibility that a missile struck Flight 800.
<p>
   Even if the Feds finally establish what happened, they will be
far from discovering the who and the why. At this stage they can
only draw on the experience of earlier crashes to guess at
probabilities.
<p>
   The problem is that guesses won't satisfy an impatient and
frightened public, and wrong guesses only inflame the conspiracy
theorists while inevitably disappointing the rest.
<p>
   In theory, investigators have the tools to perform miracles. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
labs can identify a speck of explosive weighing as little as a
trillionth of a gram.
<p>
   By listening to the four microphones feeding the cockpit
recorder in a given jet, experts should be able to learn the
distance and direction of shock waves, helping them pinpoint the
location of an explosive. Experience has been less successful.
<p>
   The recordings made by the black boxes in two earlier bomb
attacks on 747s  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103 over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX>,
killing 270, and an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-India</ENAMEX> Flight above the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irish Sea</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX>,
killing 329  &MD;  also ended abruptly with unexplained noises.
<p>
   The recorders failed because the disasters cut off the jet's
electrical power. After the downing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> 103, the British
government recommended that the black boxes be hooked up to
batteries so they would continue recording information for a few
more seconds as the plane went down.
<p>
   But the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> government has done little to require airlines to
put battery-powered recorders on American aircraft.
<p>
   For all the public frustration at its seeming lassitude, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
800 case is proceeding at a fairly typical pace. It took
investigators only six days to discover that a bomb blew up <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>
103. But <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX>'s 747 fell to the ground, not into the sea, making
the evidence much easier to recover.
<p>
   Even then, it took two months to identify fragments of the bomb
and three years to indict a pair of Libyan terrorists  &MD;  who have
yet to be tried. The bombing of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-India</ENAMEX> flight has never been
fully solved.
<p>
   That plane fell into 6,700 feet of water in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Irish Sea</ENAMEX>, and
rescue workers were able to recover little of it. Gumshoes are also
mindful of another 747 crash that was initially thought to be a
bombing  &MD;  but turned out to be the result of a mechanical failure.
<p>
   In <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX> a jet owned by an Austrian airline suddenly went down
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Thailand</ENAMEX>. Police were about to arrest a disgruntled employee
who had made bomb threats when they discovered that one of the
767's <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pratt &AMP; Whitney</ENAMEX> engines had reversed thrust in midair,
flingiBut other 747s crippled by catastrophic mechanical failure
managed to stay in the air for a time as their pilots struggled for
control  &MD;  for six minutes when an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">El Al</ENAMEX> cargo plane went down in
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Amsterdam</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1992</TIMEX>, and for 32 excruciating minutes before a Je.
Twice, 747s have survived bomb attacks: one as it approached
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Honolulu</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1982</TIMEX> and another over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pakistan</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">two years later</TIMEX>.
<p>
   The fact that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 800 did not is ominous: it suggests that if
there was a bomber, he was a pro, no matter what his motives w
<p>
   The efforts to clarify the record just added to the uncertainty
and illustrate the difficulty of trying to coordinate a difficult
probe conducted by an alphabet soup of state and federal agencies.
<p>
   The conflict between the families of the victiound dozens of
bodies  &MD;  possibly as many as 100  &MD;  trapped in the sunken fuselage,
raising hopes of a quick recovery effort.
<p>
   His information was quickly contradicted by officials from the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX>, who insisted that only a handful of bodies had been fopment
on the scene? Why weren't they prepared to have more divers?''
<p>
   The official was overwrought  &MD;  there were scores of frogmen on
the scene  &MD;  but it did take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">navy</ENAMEX> almost a week to bring in a
proper dive ship. It was the Grasp, whose 35 ``harding slowly to
avoid the bends.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX> medical examiner, Dr. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Charles Wetli</ENAMEX>, has been
bitterly criticized by the families for taking too long to identify
their relatives' remains.
<p>
   But to attach names to the often-mutilated corpses,eth. For some
of the 40-odd French victims, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wetli</ENAMEX> had to roust French dentists
back from their <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">summer</TIMEX> holidays. The French have been particularly
agitated about delays in recovering the bodies.

<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>, in his deliberate, plodding voice.
<p>
   Fortunately, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX> has managed to bond with his <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> opposite,
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James Kallents</ENAMEX> along the way: <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> men stopped <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">NTSB</ENAMEX> officials from
photographing the wreckage because ``they didn't want our people

to a secure <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> lab, says <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Francis</ENAMEX>.

<p>
   Talking to reporters aboard <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air Force</ENAMEX> One, chief of staff <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Leon

at terrorism and that ``chemical leftovers'' had been recovered
from the crash site. But hourray. Some <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> officials opined
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Panetta</ENAMEX>, who felt pressured and weary, may have just pulled a
garbled report off CNN.

<p>
   Federal officials investigating the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World
Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that they were making a detailed
comparison of foreign air crashes caused by bombs in their search
for information that could help them prove their theory that the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 was brought down by a bomb.
<p>
   Although the officials said they were not ready to declare the
crash a result of a criminal act, they are comparing the evidence
gathered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> downing of a French airliner
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air India</ENAMEX> airliner that was blamed
on a bomb.
<p>
   The federal officials said they are consulting foreign
investigators and examining material from those earlier crashes as
a way of testing the theory that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound 747 was bombed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX>, who is heading the investigation, said: ``Certainly,
I think we've acknowledged from the beginning that there's a
possibility that this could have been an act that would be
comparable to those. And we're doing what we would do in any
accident investigation and that is comparing the things that have
similarities.''
<p>
   For the first time <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, officials publicly said that the
catastrophic event that apparently broke the airplane in two,
whether caused by an explosion or a mechanical malfunction,
occurred near the front of the airplane. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Cantamessa Jr.</ENAMEX>, the
special agent in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, said the
bodies of victims sitting near the front of the plane showed more
severe injuries, indicating they ``experienced the bulk of the
significant event.''
<p>
   Officials have said that the front part of the plane apparently
separated from the rest of the plane and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX> before the rest of the aircraft.
<p>
   Investigators said they were one piece of evidence away from
declaring the crash a criminal act, but that evidence continued to
elude them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Divers continued pulling large pieces of wreckage from the ocean
off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>, and preliminary tests on some of them
showed traces of explosives. But for those pieces, and others
pulled up in previous days, more sophisticated testing at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
laboratory in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> failed to confirm the early positive
tests.
<p>
   In addition, investigators said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">afternoon</TIMEX>, metal that at
first seemed to bear a pockmarked pattern consistent with an
explosion, turned out to have been marred by having been submerged
in the ocean.
<p>
   Officials also said that the final loud noise picked up by the
airplane's cockpit voice recorder just before it stopped working on
the night of the crash would not alone provide enough evidence for
investigators to determine the nature of the cataclysmic event.
<p>
   ``We're all a little frustrated by not being able to find the
cause of this occurrence,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantamessa</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight crashed the day after a French magistrate left
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX>, where he had been investigating the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> bombing of a DC-10
over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sahara Desert</ENAMEX>. All 170 people on board that plane were
killed.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Transport Ministry</ENAMEX> said shortly after the French jet
went down <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">seven years ago</TIMEX> that information from the plane's data
recorders ``showed that the flight proceeded in a normal manner
until a total interruption, which translates as an explosion in
flight.''
<p>
   ``The work of the crew was proceeding normally when the
recording of words and electronic data abruptly stopped,'' the
statement said.
<p>
   The data and voice recorders on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight also stopped
abruptly, but American investigators said they were drawing no
conclusions from that.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">The Associated Press</ENAMEX> reported three days after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> accident
that investigators had found evidence of explosives on board. The
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">AP</ENAMEX> also reported that a plane flying the same flight had been
bombed on the ground in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N'Djamena</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX>, in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1984</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> reported <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX> that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">France</ENAMEX> planned to try four
Libyan suspects in absentia, including a brother-in-law of Col.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Moammar Gadhafy</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abdallah Senoussi</ENAMEX>. The report quoted lawyers
familiar with the case as saying that <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Libya</ENAMEX> had refused to turn
over the suspects to French officials.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 18</TIMEX>, the day after the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight exploded en route to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Reuters</ENAMEX> quoted a spokesman for the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Foreign Ministry</ENAMEX>
as saying that the magistrate, Judge <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jean-Louis Bruguiere</ENAMEX> ``was
received cordially by the Libyan judicial authorities.''
<p>
   A senior American intelligence official said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> that
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> had no evidence of any connection between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
crash and the pursuit of suspects by French authorities in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX>
bombing.
<p>
   The decision to conduct more thorough comparisons with the
foreign crashes does not necessarily reveal any conclusions on the
part of the investigators, but it reveals some of their thinking
about the crash.
<p>
   A steady stream of wreckage is moving from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> headquarters, but none of the pieces have provided conclusive
evidence to support the leading theory among law enforcement
officials that the plane was destroyed by a bomb.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantamessa</ENAMEX> said: ``Where it will wind up we don't actually or
cannot exactly say right now. We're expecting some more results
from forensic stuff that has been sent down to the laboratory. To
this time, we have nothing conclusive.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Federal officials investigating the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans
World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 are making a detailed study of several
airline crashes caused by bombs, searching for clues that could
help them determine whether the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> 747 was also brought down by a
bomb.
<p>
   Although the officials said they were not ready to declare the
crash a result of a criminal act, they are comparing the evidence
gathered in the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> crash to the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1988</TIMEX> bombing of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> Flight 103
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Lockerbie</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotland</ENAMEX>, the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> downing of a French airliner
over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX> and a <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1985</TIMEX> crash of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air India</ENAMEX> airliner that was
attributed to a bomb.
<p>
   The federal officials said they were consulting foreign
investigators and examining material from those earlier crashes as
a way of testing the theory that the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 was
bombed.
<p>
   ``We've acknowledged from the beginning that there's a
possibility that this could have been an act that would be
comparable to those,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robert Francis</ENAMEX>, the vice chairman of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>, who is heading the
investigation ``And we're doing what we would do in any accident
investigation and that is comparing the things that have
similarities.''
<p>
   Officials also said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that the catastrophic event that
apparently broke the airplane in two  &MD;  whether it was caused by an
explosion or by mechanical malfunction  &MD;  occurred near the front of
the airplane. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Joseph Cantamessa Jr.</ENAMEX>, the special agent in charge of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, said the bodies of victims sitting near
the front of the plane showed more severe injuries, indicating they
``experienced the bulk of the significant event.''
<p>
   Officials have said that the front part of the plane apparently
separated from the rest of the plane and plunged into the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic
Ocean</ENAMEX> before the rest of the aircraft.
<p>
   Investigators have said in recent days that they were just one
piece of evidence away from declaring the crash a criminal act, but
that evidence continued to elude them on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Some airplane parts pulled from the water off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> have
initially tested positive for traces of explosives. But officials
said on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> that more sophisticated tests at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> laboratory
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX> failed to confirm any of the early positive tests.
<p>
   Metal from the airplane that investigators first thought bore
the pockmarked pattern consistent with an explosion turned out to
have been marred by the ocean's salt water.
<p>
   And officials also said that the final loud noise picked up by
the airplane's cockpit voice recorder just before it stopped
working on the night of the crash would not alone provide enough
evidence for investigators to determine the nature of the
cataclysmic event.
<p>
   ``We're all a little frustrated by not being able to find the
cause of this occurrence,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cantamessa</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The investigators hope to find some clues in the records of the
foreign crashes, which on the surface at least, bear some
similarities to Flight 800.
<p>
   Both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air India</ENAMEX> crashes involved 747's. In
both cases, the cockpit voice recorder tapes ended with a
fraction-of-a-second noise, which also happened on the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight.
And the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> airplane seemed to break in a somewhat similar pattern
to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> flight.
<p>
   The finding that the on-board recorders from the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> flight
showed no mechanical problems before the crash echoed the report of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">French Transport Ministry</ENAMEX> on the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX> crash over the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Sahara
Desert</ENAMEX>. The French ministry reported that DC-10's data recorders
``showed that the flight proceeded in a normal manner until a total
interruption, which translates as an explosion in flight.'' It said
``the work of the crew was proceeding normally when the recording
of words and electronic data abruptly stopped.''
<p>
   That crash, of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Union de Transports Aeriens</ENAMEX> airliner over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX>,
killed all 170 people on board. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-India</ENAMEX> crash off the coast
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ireland</ENAMEX> killed 329 people, and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> explosion killed 270.
<p>
   Authorities have linked both the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pan Am</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chad</ENAMEX> bombings to
Libyan terrorists. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Air-India</ENAMEX> bombing was blamed on <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Sikh</ENAMEX>
separatists.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">BOHEMIA</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  The fiery ending of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 cast a harsh
light into various corners of the aviation business. But some key
data for investigating the disaster came from a tiny industry niche
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Bohemia</ENAMEX> that the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> never knew
existed.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">The morning after the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX> disaster</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John R. Keller</ENAMEX> called
directory assistance and asked for the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX> headquarters
of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>. ``I have a radar map of the accident,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> told the
agent who answered the phone.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Keller</ENAMEX> is executive vice president of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata Corp.</ENAMEX>, which was
able to provide air-traffic records more quickly and completely
than the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> of the seconds before and
after the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Paris</ENAMEX>-bound <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 disappeared from radar screens.
<p>
   The data helped investigators determine which other aircraft in
the vicinity had the clearest eyewitness view of the disaster and
its immediate aftermath.
<p>
   Tiny <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s role in the investigation highlights a chink in
air-to-ground communications that is not widely recognized by the
public but is apparent enough to some airline and airport
officials, and the company has been able to make a business of
plugging the gap.
<p>
   Clients include <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">United Airlines</ENAMEX>, which uses <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s
technology to coordinate ground crews in five cities during the
last few minutes of incoming flights  &MD;  a period when the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> limits
communications with planes to essential conversations between
cockpit and controllers.
<p>
   Other <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> customers include airports  &MD;  though none in
metropolitan <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>  &MD;  whose managers need to know which planes
were where and when if disputes arise over noise-abatement
violations and the like.
<p>
   In essence, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>, based in an industrial park near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long
Island MacArthur Airport</ENAMEX>, produces a <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$250,000</NUMEX> system that
eavesdrops on radio transmissions between the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and commercial
airplanes.
<p>
   Using computers and software more advanced than anything
available to federal air controllers, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> system massages
information and converts it to an instant, real-time view of all
aircraft aloft and their flight paths within a 150-mile radius. The
setup maintains a data base of this information and is able to
instantly reproduce air-traffic records that might take the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>
days or weeks to compile.
<p>
   ``It's a completely clandestine operation; they don't even know
we're there,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">George B. Litchford</ENAMEX>, an engineer who holds the
system's patent.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Litchford</ENAMEX> has been licensing the technology to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> since
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1989</TIMEX>. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX> is thought to be the only company in this business
so far. (It is hardly a gold-mine business. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>, whose stock
is thinly traded on the OTC Bulletin Board, has revenues of less
than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$2 million</NUMEX> a year from a range of communications products, and
it lost money <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">last year</TIMEX>. The shares closed at <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">50 cents</NUMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>,
down <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">37.5 cents</NUMEX> each, after spiking upward <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Tuesday</TIMEX> on word of the
company's involvement in the plane-crash investigation.)
<p>
   Although the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> was unaware of
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s existence before the crash, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> has known about the
company but has ignored it.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Megadata</ENAMEX>'s services may be useful to airlines for efficiently
moving people on the ground, said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bill Jeffers</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX>'s director
of air traffic. But ``it doesn't have to do with the safe and
efficient movement of aircraft,'' which <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Jeffers</ENAMEX> said was his
agency's concern.

<p>
   In addition to the obligatory beverages and bags of peanuts,
passengers aboard a few <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> airplanes now have access to a new
in-flight telephone system. But if the airplane experiences an
``in-flight anomaly''  &MD;  industry jargon for potential disasters  &MD; 
the company recommends that pilots disconnect the telephone service
to protect its image.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Early this month</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> issued a memorandum informing the
airline's pilots that <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Airfone</ENAMEX> services had been retained to
provide telephone service in the company's airplanes. The memo went
on to provide a time frame for the installations, the fees to
passengers and the procedure for reporting problems.
<p>
   But the last paragraph deviated from the mundane.
<p>
   ``There may be occasions where an in-flight anomaly could occur
where it is desirable to disable the phone system,'' it said.
``<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> prefers to furnish press releases for in-flight anomalies
instead of having this information reported live via telephone from
the aircraft! The captain is encouraged to use his discretion in
deactivating the phone system by pulling the circuit breaker in
these instances.''
<p>
   The memorandum was written by Capt. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Sturpe</ENAMEX>, manager of
flight operation procedures for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>. It was issued <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 2</TIMEX>, two
weeks after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 exploded off the coast
of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Officials for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>, the country's sixth-largest carrier,
confirmed that the memo was authentic, but they said that senior
management officials had not been aware of it until a reporter
called them <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``That language has been rescinded,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Richard M. Weintraub</ENAMEX>, a
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> spokesman, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Wednesday</TIMEX>. He acknowledged that the wording
was inappropriate, but added: ``The intent was to prevent a
situation where a phone call from a passenger on an aircraft could
have interfered with the safety or security of the aircraft.''
<p>
   In-flight telephones, which have become increasingly popular,
allow passengers to conduct business en route or to call ahead to
destinations. They have also figured in several recent action films
in which protagonists have called to report villainous activities
aboard their planes.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Laura Littel</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">GTE Airfones</ENAMEX>, which is based in
in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oak Brook</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Ill.</ENAMEX>, said she could understand the recommendation.
``The only thing I could think of would be a hijacking. Someone
could use the phone to say, `I want this plane to go to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" STATUS="OPT">XYZ</ENAMEX>, or I'm
going to do something.' That is a potential.''

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEW YORK</ENAMEX>  &MD;  From the <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX> daily cost of rented salvage ships
to the price of high-tech forensic equipment to police overtime,
the investigation into the crash of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800
is already the nation's most expensive aircraft-accident
investigation.
<p>
   The investigation's full cost will not be known until it is
completed, a process that is likely to take months. But federal and
local officials said that expenses were rapidly approaching <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$10
million</NUMEX>, and a dispute has already erupted over whether <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>, its
insurer and other private parties will help pay the bills.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Earlier this week</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>
officials sent a letter to <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> asking the airline for a voluntary
payment of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$5 million</NUMEX> toward salvage and recovery costs, according
to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mark Abels</ENAMEX>, a company spokesman. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX> said <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s position
was that it bore no responsibility to help pay the government's
bills.
<p>
   ``We think this is a government expenditure,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Abels</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Goelz</ENAMEX>, a safety board spokesman, said that the agency
expected that private parties would resist paying for the inquiry
if it was determined that the crash of Flight 800 was caused by a
criminal act. If not, the decision of how much, if any, individual
companies will pay is largely up to them.
<p>
   Safety board officials estimated that the investigation was
costing the agency more than <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$100,000</NUMEX> a day, or <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$3 million</NUMEX> to date.
The agency has an annual budget of <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$38 million</NUMEX>, but only about <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1
million</NUMEX> of that is dedicated to accident investigations like the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> case. The agency's resources have also been taxed by a other
recent disasters, including the crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Valujet</ENAMEX> plane into the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida Everglades</ENAMEX> in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">May</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``Certainly, this is the most expensive accident investigation
that we have encountered,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bernard Loeb</ENAMEX>, the director of the
safety board's office of aviation safety.
<p>
   A safety board spokesman said that before the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> inquiry, the
agency's previous largest expenditure probably involved the
investigation of the <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1994</TIMEX> crash of a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX> jet upon its approach to
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Pittsburgh</ENAMEX>. He said that inquiry had cost <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1 million</NUMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Loeb</ENAMEX> said the agency often turned to private parties like an
airline's insurer or a plane's manufacturer to contribute to an
investigation's salvage costs. But the chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s insurer
disputed the notion that such contributions were routine and said
that an airline's insurer typically paid only for the cost of
environmental cleanups at a crash site.
<p>
   ``The government is obviously expending a lot of effort and
cost, and there will be invitations for people to contribute if
they want to contribute,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Howard Clark</ENAMEX>, chairman of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S.
Aviation Underwriters</ENAMEX>, which represents a pool of insurers. ``But
how does this become <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s problem or our problem?''
<p>
   One expert in the aviation insurance industry said he believed
that the cost of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> investigation could reach <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$50 million</NUMEX>
before it was completed. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goelz</ENAMEX>, the safety board spokesman, said
that he expected the agency to seek more funds from <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Congress</ENAMEX>
shortly.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>, which has assigned 500 agents to hunt for clues to the
disaster, is also running up a mountain of bills for motels, meals,
airline tickets and other expenses. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Paul Bresson</ENAMEX>, a spokesman for
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Washington</ENAMEX>, said the agency did not yet have an estimate
of its costs in <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> case. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">James K. Kallstrom</ENAMEX>, the assistant
director in charge of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX> office, has joked that he
has been signing chits for money his office does not have.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Suffolk County</ENAMEX>, officials said the huge costs they were
incurring had forced them to reach out to state and federal
officials for help. ``We have never had a disaster that has
required this kind of expenditure,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Kenneth Weiss</ENAMEX>, the
county's budget director.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Weiss</ENAMEX> said that through <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 9</TIMEX>, work by the local rescue
personnel, police and the medical examiner's office had cost the
county <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$4.2 million</NUMEX>, with <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$1.4 million</NUMEX> of that for overtime
payments. Other expenses have included <NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$181,000</NUMEX> to buy the DNA
testing equipment that was used to help identify victims and
<NUMEX TYPE="MONEY">$60,000</NUMEX> to enlarge a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Coast Guard</ENAMEX> helicopter landing pad, he said.
<p>
   Both federal and local officials have said they will spare no
expense in determining the disaster's cause. But the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>
investigation is proving particularly costly because submerged
fragments of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 are scattered over a broad area off the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> coast. Several federal agencies in addition to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FBI</ENAMEX>
are involved in the inquiry.

<p>
   Indeed, a plan to do so has been in the works for many months,
spurred on by intelligence warnings that the threat of terror
attacks on aircraft in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX> is growing, and the plan
is only being accelerated following the explosion of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight
800.
<p>
   An industry advisory group formed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> that has been
working on security issues for more than a year formed a task force
at a meeting just hours before <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 exploded over
waters near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX> after taking off from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Kennedy Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Members had been told to come up with recommendations for
enhancing security and to make their report in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">October</TIMEX>. But the
vice president's commission is supposed to have preliminary
recommendations even earlier, so the two groups have been working
very closely together in recent weeks.
<p>
   Officials cautioned that the vice president's commission, which
has not yet held its first full-blown meeting, might decide to
reject the recommendations of the industry advisory group.
<p>
   The discussions between the groups shows how much tension there
is between the industry and the government over how to respond to
the growing risk of terrorism in general, especially in the wake of
the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> disaster.
<p>
   Even before the cause of that disaster is explained  &MD;  and as
investigators have basically ruled out a bomb in a checked suitcase
as the explanation, since all the luggage containers on the plane
were recovered undamaged by any bomb  &MD;  the aviation industry and
the government have been negotiating over how to minimize the costs
of deploying new bomb-detecting equipment.
<p>
   The approach being pushed by industry advisory groups, with the
support of senior officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>, would
lower the costs of the bomb detection process by instead building
up the process known as ``profiling,'' which attempts to focus
attention on certain passengers and their baggage.
<p>
   The new approach was first reported in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX> editions of The
Washington Post, and details were confirmed by government and
industry officials.
<p>
   Already, although they may not know it, airline passengers are
profiled when they buy their tickets and when they check in for
their flights, and those who match certain criteria, some of which
are secret, are subjected to extra baggage checks.
<p>
   People whose passports are issued by nations known to support
terrorism, or people who have traveled to such countries, or people
who pay cash for one-way tickets just before a flight, would be
checked more carefully under the current profile.
<p>
   After the explosion aboard Flight 800, the profiling measures
were extended to many domestic flights.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LOS ANGELES</ENAMEX>  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Norman and Beverly Jean Wascher</ENAMEX> took off from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eureka</ENAMEX> in their single-engine Aero Commander 114 on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Father's Day
1977</TIMEX> and simply vanished.
<p>
   The discovery of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Rockwell</ENAMEX> aircraft in a remote <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Humboldt
County</ENAMEX> forest <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX> by lumber company workers  &MD;  <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">19 years later</TIMEX>  &MD; 
may at last bring some peace to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Robin Wascher</ENAMEX>, the couple's
daughter.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>, who faced <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">almost two decades</TIMEX> of uncertainty over her
parents' fate, was the former air traffic controller who in <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1991</TIMEX>
cleared a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 jetliner to land atop a commuter jet, killing
34 people at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Los Angeles International Airport</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, the day after she learned that her parents' plane
had been found, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> said she hoped the discovery will help her
put her life back together.
<p>
   ``My family has been waiting 19 years for this,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>
from her <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nevada</ENAMEX> home. ``We are all just unbelievably happy that we
finally found the airplane and we can finally close this chapter in
all of our lives.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pacific Lumber Co.</ENAMEX> workers were conducting a timber survey in a
mountainous area near <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotia</ENAMEX> when they found the wreckage <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>,
according to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Humboldt County Sheriff's Department</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Scotia</ENAMEX> is about 200 miles northwest of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Francisco</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   At first, authorities believed the plane was an aircraft
reported missing <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a year ago</TIMEX>, but they learned it belonged to
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>'s parents after tracing its identification number.
<p>
   Deputies found no human remains, but they did recover the
couple's personal property, including identification, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   ``One side of the plane was wrecked, and they think animals
might have drug them off,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> said. ``They don't think it's
probable that they walked away. But they're going back to see if
the seat belts were released.''
<p>
   Deputies told <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> that they will be bringing in dogs to
search for skeletal remains.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>, who was an air traffic controller before her parents
were killed, has resolved to never work again as a controller.
<p>
   The last time she did, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb. 1, 1991</TIMEX>, she cleared the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">USAir</ENAMEX>
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 737 jetliner that landed atop a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">SkyWest</ENAMEX> commuter jet.
<p>
   After an eight-month investigation, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation
Safety Board</ENAMEX> investigation concluded that the crash was not
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>'s fault but rather a result of flawed procedures at <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LAX</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   It has been <TIMEX TYPE="DATE" STATUS="OPT">five years since the crash</TIMEX>, but not a day goes by
that <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> isn't reminded of the accident. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> later went on
disability and moved to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Henderson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Nev.</ENAMEX>, a suburb of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Las Vegas</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   ``I loved my job and it was the hardest thing I've every had to
go through,'' she said. ``The accident is always with me.''
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> admits to a sad distinction among air traffic
controllers. She was involved in a major accident, yet lost family
members in a plane crash.
<p>
   ``I know what people feel like in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">L.A.</ENAMEX> accident,'' she said.
``It's really hard to deal with.''
<p>
   She described her parents as a loving couple, inseparable from
one another.
<p>
   ``My mom once told me that if they were to die, they would go
together because they were extremely close,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   The couple was en route to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oxnard</ENAMEX> from a visit to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Northern
California</ENAMEX> on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">June 19, 1977</TIMEX>, when their Aero Commander was lost
soon after takeoff from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Eureka</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> and her sisters  &MD;  <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Heidi Wascher</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Santa Barbara</ENAMEX> and
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Cherie Matis</ENAMEX> of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Temecula</ENAMEX>  &MD;  expect to find the closure they seek
when they visit the crash site <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">next week</TIMEX> and later hold a memorial
service.
<p>
   ``The first couple of years, it basically affected all of our
lives pretty hard,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX> said. ``We didn't know where our
parent's plane was. It was amazing how a plane could disappear
after being up only 15 minutes.''
<p>
   While the discovery of the airplane will bring a measure of
peace to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Wascher</ENAMEX>'s life, nothing can erase from the memory of <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Feb.
1, 1991</TIMEX>, the day 34 people died on an <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">LAX</ENAMEX> runway.
<p>
   ``That's tough to live with,'' she said.

<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX>, <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sept. 5</TIMEX> (<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION" STATUS="OPT">Bloomberg</ENAMEX>) -- About half a million coastal
residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>'s <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Outer Banks</ENAMEX> were
evacuated <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> as Hurricane Fran headed toward land with winds of
115 miles per hour and waves as high as 21-22 feet.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Air Force</ENAMEX> Hurricane Hunter aircraft reported maximum
sustained winds near Fran's center of 115 mph, with some gusts
higher.
<p>
   Tides of 12-16 feet above normal and battering waves are
possible northeast of the point where Fran's center strikes land
along the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Carolinas</ENAMEX>, forecasters said.
<p>
   Rainfall of 5-10 inches is expected and isolated tornadoes are
possible over parts of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North and South Carolina</ENAMEX>, the forecasters
also said.
<p>
   ``Winds of tropical-storm force will reach the coast shortly and
hurricane-force winds will arrive by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this evening</TIMEX>,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Rappaport</ENAMEX>
said. ``Hurricane-force winds are expected inland as far as 100
miles from Fran's path.''
<p>
   Computer-generated images of Fran's track predict the hurricane
to go ashore near the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> border.
<p>
   A hurricane warning was in effect from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Edisto Beach</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South
Carolina</ENAMEX>, to the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> border. A hurricane
watch and tropical-storm warning extended northward from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North
Carolina</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> border to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chincoteague</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>, including
the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hampton Roads</ENAMEX> area.
<p>
   A tropical-storm warning is in effect for the lower <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Chesapeake
Bay</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The hurricane is expected to hit land around the border of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South
and North Carolina</ENAMEX>, with forecasters predicting a landfall <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">late
this evening</TIMEX>.
<p>
   ``The big unknown is how strong Fran will be at the time of
landfall,'' said <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Lixion Avila</ENAMEX>, an expert at the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Miami</ENAMEX> center. ``The
hurricane has been fluctuating in intensity and could reach the
coast during one of the up or down trends.''
<p>
   At <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">1 p.m. local time</TIMEX>, Fran's center was located by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National
Weather Service</ENAMEX> Doppler radar at about 140 miles southeast of the
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> border, compared with 180 miles at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11
a.m.</TIMEX>
<p>
   Hurricane-force winds of 74 mph and higher extended outward
about 145 miles, and tropical-storm winds of 39 mph and higher
ranged 290 miles north of Fran's center.
<p>
   Fran was moving north-northwest at 16 mph, up from 14 mph
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">earlier today</TIMEX>. Forecasters expect this motion to continue through
<TIMEX TYPE="TIME">tonight</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Fran's barometric pressure was 28.17 inches, unchanged from <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">11
a.m. local time</TIMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>'s governor <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> ordered all coastal
residents from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Beaufort</ENAMEX> north to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Myrtle Beach</ENAMEX> to evacuate their
homes. Gov. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">David Beasley</ENAMEX> said all of the state's coast line was
vulnerable to Fran.
<p>
   In <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX>, residents of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Oracoke Island</ENAMEX>, along the
southern terminus of the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Cape Hatteras National Seashore</ENAMEX>, began a
voluntary evacuation <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">last night</TIMEX>. The last ferry left the island
community for the mainland and <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Hatteras</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">this morning</TIMEX>.
<p>
   Emergency management officials in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> urged residents
of barrier islands and low-lying beaches to secure their homes and
property and go inland. <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">North Carolina</ENAMEX> emergency management
officials reported 40 to 50 shelters were open to coastal evacuees.
<p>
   Unmanned, computer operated buoys off the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX> coast
reported hurricane force winds and seas of 21 feet. Water
temperatures, a key ingredient in sustaining a hurricane's
strength, were in 80 degree range.
<p>
   According to the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal Emergency Management Agency</ENAMEX>, winds of
111 mph to 130 mph have the potential to uproot trees, damage
roofs, windows and doors.
<p>
   Small structures and mobile homes near the coast would be
destroyed and sea level storm surges from the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Atlantic Ocean</ENAMEX> could
reach 12 feet, cutting off coastal escape routes 3-5 hours before
the storm.
<p>
   To prepare for the storm, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX> placed its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Emergency
Response Team</ENAMEX> on full alert. <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FEMA</ENAMEX>, the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX> agency charged with
coordinating disaster assistance, said advance elements of its <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">ERT</ENAMEX>
group reached <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Columbia</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South Carolina</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">7 a.m. local time</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>.
The team will coordinate federal activities in areas affected by
Hurricane Fran.
<p>
   In related developments, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Transportation</ENAMEX>
said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Amtrak</ENAMEX> will cancel its <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York</ENAMEX>-<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Florida</ENAMEX> trains that
pass through areas affected coastal areas.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Department of Agriculture</ENAMEX> said it stocked food supplies
in the hurricane warning areas and reports bulk food warehouses are
full. The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Army Corps of Engineers</ENAMEX> has 25,000 gallons of
bottled water available and 200 portable generators.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">General Services Administration</ENAMEX> arranged for tractor
trailers to move roofing-grade plastic sheeting from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">U.S.</ENAMEX>
government storage in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Palmetto</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Jackson</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South
Carolina</ENAMEX>. Nine trailers with food supplies left <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Gillem</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Georgia</ENAMEX>, at <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">8 a.m. local time</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">today</TIMEX> for <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Fort Jackson</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">U.S. Coast Guard</ENAMEX> search and rescue boats and equipment were
moved to shelters away from the hurricane so they well be ready for
service after Fran makes a landfall.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Department of Defense</ENAMEX> moved aircraft out of Fran's strike
path and positioned transport planes to be available for use by
federal emergency agencies.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Red Cross</ENAMEX> officials said it has 56 shelters in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">South
Carolina</ENAMEX> ready to receive evacuees and 31 emergency response
vehicles ready should Fran make a landfall in that state.
<p>
   Hurricane Fran brushed by the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION" MIN="Bahamas Islands">northwest Bahamas Islands</ENAMEX>
<TIMEX TYPE="DATE">yesterday</TIMEX> with winds of 80 mph and high seas, causing some
widespread power outages on outer islands. No deaths were reported,
forecasters said.

COMPLICATIONS ARISE IN CHRISTENING A NEW AIRCRAFT CARRIER
(For use by <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York Times News Service</ENAMEX> clients)
By <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">JAMES KUHNHENN</ENAMEX>
c. <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">1996</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Kansas City Star</ENAMEX>

<TEXT>
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">NEWPORT NEWS</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>  &MD;  Illnesses, legalities, disasters and
champagne. The setbacks for the USS Harry S. Truman's christening
just kept on coming, like high swells in rough seas.
<p>
   <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>, literally in the aftermath of a storm, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX>'s
newest aircraft carrier is scheduled to be christened. Only at the
end will organizers uncross their cramped fingers and sigh.
<p>
   First, the illness. <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Margaret Truman Daniel</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX>'s daughter,
was chosen the ship's sponsor  &MD;  normally a task that would grant
her the honor of actually christening the ship. But <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX> is
recuperating from an infection and won't be able to attend.
<p>
   ``It's not quite healed yet,'' she said in a telephone interview
from her home in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">New York City</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Instead, the christening honors belong to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drucie S. Horton</ENAMEX>, a
longtime friend of <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Daniel</ENAMEX> whose father, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">John Snyder</ENAMEX>, was <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX>'s
secretary of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Treasury</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   Then there was the business about the champagne. In a tradition
that dates to Viking human sacrifices, ships have been sent to sea
with the ceremonial spillage of some type of precious fluid. These
days, blood has given way to champagne. And as <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Truman</ENAMEX> hailed from
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX>, organizers suggested a nice <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Missouri</ENAMEX> bubbly might do the
trick.
<p>
   So about <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">a month ago</TIMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Ruth Flynn</ENAMEX>, the marketing director at the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Mount Pleasant Winery</ENAMEX> in <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Augusta</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Mo.</ENAMEX>, submitted a couple of
bottles of their Genesis Champagne for consideration. But like an
offended oenophile, <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newport News Shipbuilding</ENAMEX> rejected the offer  &MD; 
the bottles would not break on impact.
<p>
   ``Rather than give up, we decided to check our supply,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Flynn</ENAMEX>
said. ``We picked out a very cheap bottle. We put our champagne in
it, labeled it, and asked how many bottles they wanted.''
<p>
   These bottles, much thinner and lighter, passed muster.
<p>
   So, at the appointed time, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Drucie Horton</ENAMEX> will hurl a bottle of
Genesis Champagne against the carrier. The bottle, upon impact,
should explode in a spray of glass and lightly rose colored
sparkling wine. Those with the appropriate nose for this sort of
thing might catch the aroma of yeast, raspberries, oranges and
molasses.
<p>
   However, another reversal came on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Thursday</TIMEX>, when President
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> canceled plans to attend the christening after <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX>
and campaign lawyers warned it would be considered a political
event.
<p>
   ``The assumption was that the commander in chief could christen
one of his own boats,'' <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> spokesman <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Mike McCurry</ENAMEX> told
reporters.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">McCurry</ENAMEX> said that according to <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX>'s legal advisers,
everything a president does between his nomination and <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Election Day</TIMEX>
is considered political except events connected to national
security or natural disasters.
<p>
   And speaking of disasters: Hurricane Fran struck southeast
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">morning</TIMEX> and by <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">noon</TIMEX> <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Newport News</ENAMEX> was without power.
<ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Bunny Hodges</ENAMEX>, a spokeswoman at <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Newport News Shipbuilding</ENAMEX>, was
operating by flashlight, and power company officials were
speculating that electricity in some areas would not be restored
for days.
<p>
   Initial plans called for about 16,000 people to attend the
event. The president's absence and the storm's heavy hand might
keep the number down.
<p>
   In any event, organizers are breathing a little easier  &MD;  at
least the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Secret Service</ENAMEX>, and all the stringent security details it
brings along, will be staying away.

   The pilot of an <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> jet has told the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Federal
Aviation Administration</ENAMEX> that he saw a missile off the wing of his
plane while he was flying along the coast of <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   The plane, a <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 757, was heading to <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Boston</ENAMEX> from <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">San Juan</ENAMEX>,
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Puerto Rico</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Aug. 29</TIMEX> when the missile passed. The pilot said the
plane was over <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wallops Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Va.</ENAMEX>, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Aeronautics
and Space Administration</ENAMEX> operates a center for unmanned research
rockets.
<p>
   The <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX> is investigating the
report, which a spokesman, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Peter Goelz</ENAMEX>, said had been received by
the agency on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Friday</TIMEX>. He could not say when the report was
originally filed.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goelz</ENAMEX> said there had never been an incident of a missile
accidentally hitting a civilian aircraft in the <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">United States</ENAMEX>.
<p>
   While a missile strike is one of the theories investigators are
pursuing in the destruction of <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Trans World Airlines</ENAMEX> Flight 800 off
<ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Long Island</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">N.Y.</ENAMEX>, on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">July 17</TIMEX>, most of them say they believe a bomb
smuggled onto the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Boeing</ENAMEX> 747 brought it down, killing all 230
people aboard.
<p>
   Officials at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Pentagon</ENAMEX> and the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">New York National Guard</ENAMEX> have
repeatedly said there were no live-fire exercises nearby on the
night Flight 800 went down. They have not reported recovering any
missile parts from the underwater wreckage.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Wallops Island</ENAMEX> is about 200 miles south of the Flight 800 crash
site, where the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">Navy</ENAMEX> resumed its search for wreckage on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
after bad weather suspended operations on <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Saturday</TIMEX>. Divers began
searching about <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">9 a.m.</TIMEX> and by the <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">end of the day</TIMEX> had recovered a
boatload of debris.
<p>
   Although it was unclear <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX> <TIMEX TYPE="TIME">night</TIMEX> from which area the
material was recovered, the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">National Transportation Safety Board</ENAMEX>
said that the salvage ship Grapple had been scheduled to conduct
its search over the field containing the rear two-thirds of the
aircraft.
<p>
   A spokesman for <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX>, <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Chris Chiames</ENAMEX>, said <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Sunday</TIMEX>
that he could confirm that the missile sighting off <ENAMEX TYPE="LOCATION">Virginia</ENAMEX> had
occurred, but could not say precisely where the jet was at the
time, or if it was in a restricted area.
<p>
   Nor was it clear how close the object was. ``When you're that
high up, you can pretty much see anything on a clear day,'' an
official at the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">FAA</ENAMEX> said.
<p>
   <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Goelz</ENAMEX> said a regional investigator had been assigned to the
<ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">American Airlines</ENAMEX> incident. Such assignments are standard in
everything except major accidents. ``The pilot did indicate that it
was not necessary to take evasive action,'' he said.
<p>
   On <TIMEX TYPE="DATE">Monday</TIMEX> a special <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">White House</ENAMEX> commission that was created in
the aftermath of the <ENAMEX TYPE="ORGANIZATION">TWA</ENAMEX> Flight 800 crash is due to report to
President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Clinton</ENAMEX> on ways to improve aviation security, but the
panel, headed by Vice President <ENAMEX TYPE="PERSON">Al Gore</ENAMEX>, is expected to focus on
the threat of bombs smuggled into planes and not on missiles.
